# project-4---Women-in-Media-with-NLP

This project uses NLP to explore how often and when women are mentioned in the news throughout history. We used SpaCy to assess common topics for each decade, find articles mentioning women, see which topics are associated with women versus men, and see how sentiments related to women in the media have changed over time.
