1926,"A new aspirant for Tom Mix's audiences, named Ken Maynard, is introduced in a picture entitled ""Señor Daredevil,"" which is sojourning at the Colony. As the wages of a cowboy are nominal it is no wonder that occasionally a rough-rider should take a chance before the camera, especially when he hears that Mr. Mix's income is something like $2,000 a day. Mr. Maynard is good-looking and he rides so well that he makes extraordinary feats of horsemanship look comparatively simple. This vehicle, however, is not conspicuous for its originality and therefore it does not give Mr. Maynard much opportunity to show his ability as an actor. Nevertheless, in these hectic film days a prepossessing appearance is half the battle when a man has a horse he can ride, and Mr. Maynard, like Mr. Mix, has an animal called Tarzan who insists on getting his way in this yarn.This Señor Daredevil has an Irish father and a Mexican mother. They have been separated for years, owing to the incompatibility of temperaments. Daredevil's real name is Don Luis O'Flagherty, but having lived with his maternal relative most of his life he speaks like a Latin. When Tarzan insists that the young man shall ride him and not the other horse, this Don Luis O'Flagherty is quoted as saying:""You no want me to ride heem.""The plot of this Western effusion deals with a place called Goldstrike and bandits who want to starve out the Claimholders so that they can get the land for next to nothing. Food trains are constantly robbed and finally the ring leader of the rascals is put in charge of the community. Daredevil's father is ousted from the job and it is the dapper son, who first appears dressed like a bull-fighter off duty, that handles the situation so that the stakeholders come into their own.Herein are some effective scenes of a pack train going up and down a dangerous mountain trail. Mr. Maynard soon gets into the good graces of the heroine, which is no wonder, seeing that he is sufficiently resourceful to outwit the bandits and tie up some of them in sacks.Dorothy Devore lends her presence to the leading feminine rôle. That veterean screen actor, George Nichols, does well with the part of Daredevil's father. A New Rough Rider.",,1920

A voice in the airline's management, union leaders thought, would give workers reasonable control of their futures, and might, some also thought, protect against the takeover wave sweeping the airline industry. Above all, it was hoped, the strategy would protect jobs.   Late last month, the strategy foundered. As the machinists union agreed to company demands to reduce wages but refused to make further changes in work rules or benefits, Frank Lorenzo, president of Texas Air Corporation, and a man widely regarded as hostile to labor, made a takeover offer the Eastern board agreed it could not refuse. As Eastern's unions brace themselves for the kind of wage cuts and changes in work rules Mr. Lorenzo forced at Continental Airlines, another of Texas Air's recent acquisitions, labor leaders are wondering how much protection they really were able to offer.

1991,"New York City will have to build as many as three new garbage incinerators, in part because it will not be able to recycle as much trash as state goals call for, the Dinkins administration has concluded.   The new incinerators could cost at least $1 billion and will most likely prompt fierce opposition from environmental and community groups. In his 1989 mayoral campaign, David N. Dinkins had held out hope that the city would be able to address its trash disposal needs without resorting to new incinerators.   But in a plan to be disclosed today, Dinkins administration officials acknowledge that in addition to expanding three existing plants, two to three additional new incinerators will be needed.  Burning Plus Recycling    The administration also said that the city would have to burn 68 percent of its trash, slightly less than what was contemplated by the Koch administration.  The city collects 14,500 tons of waste a day. ""Even with very aggressive recycling, we still need to burn 10,000 tons,"" Steven M. Polan, the city's Sanitation Commissioner, said in an interview yesterday.   Many environmental and community groups have vehemently opposed building new incinerators because of concern over worsening air quality and neighborhood disruption by truck traffic. Incinerators emit several kinds of contaminants including soot particles containing lead, acid gases and dioxin, considered to be health risks.    The city will be able to recycle 25 percent of its trash by the year 2000, the same level required by city law but less than a state goal of as much as 42 percent by 1997, Mr. Polan said.    But any more than 25 percent cannot be economically justified because recycling markets will not be sufficiently developed to absorb all the material that New Yorkers could separate for recycling, he said.   Opponents of incinerators are very likely to take issue with the Sanitation Department analysis that only 25 percent recycling is economically feasible.   But city officials say that just to reach the 25 percent level will require adding to the six materials many New Yorkers currently separate for recycling pickup. About 6 percent of the trash collected by the Sanitation Department is now being separated under the city's struggling two-and-a-half-year-old recycling program.   Mr. Polan is to present highlights of the administration's plan at a state legislative hearing on solid waste today at 11 A.M. at 270 Broadway in New York City. A city solid waste management plan required by state law -- already five months late -- is expected to be completed and released for public comment by Nov. 1, Mr. Polan said. In the interview yesterday, Mr. Polan offered only an outline of the plan, and it was unclear when the new incinerators would be built.    After hearings in November and December, the plan will be modified and submitted to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The city cannot build trash processing or disposal plants until the plan receives state approval.   Many officials, including Mr. Dinkins's First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, maintain that recycling has limits and that with landfill capacity running out, the city has no alternative except to burn a substantial amount of its trash. Incineration proponents say modern plants are safe if properly maintained. Dinkins' 1989 Promise    In 1989, Mr. Dinkins promised to delay a decision until 1993 about building more incinerators, pending a review of the city's trash disposal needs.   ""We're not going to have giant, mass-burn incinerators in every borough belching poison into the air,"" he said, after receiving the endorsement of the New York League of Conservation Voters.   The next February, Mr. Dinkins said at a conference on the environment: ""You all know that I have some very serious concerns about the consequences of proceeding with resource-recovery plants, especially with regard to the toxic ash produced by that technology. Unless my concerns are adequately answered, we will not proceed with incineration.""   Resource-recovery plants are incinerators that convert garbage-generated steam into electric power.   Under one Koch administration plan, new incinerators would have been built in each borough. Mr. Polan said the Dinkins plan would require building two or three new incinerators and the expansion of three existing units, which is under way. Construction of an incinerator at the old Brooklyn Navy Yard remains a possibility, a department spokeswoman, Anne Canty, said.   The Sanitation Department's study found that incineration is the cheapest way to dispose of trash, Mr. Polan said, but an approach limited to burning would be at odds with the state's environmental priorities and increasing national emphasis on more recycling.   He reiterated that the city's current recycling program is struggling and needs an overhaul badly. Such an overhaul would require big revisions in the city's mandatory recycling law, which contemplated 25 percent recycling by spring 1994.   Sounding an old theme, Mr. Polan said achieving 25 percent recycling at an affordable cost will require changes in sanitation union work rules. The department needs more flexibility to move workers from collection to recycling routes, he said. Bargaining between management and the union has gone nowhere on the issue.

Murder and sex, the ballet's themes, were common currency in the psychological dance-drama of the 1940's, and Tudor was king of the genre. Yet in ""Undertow,"" he seemed almost literal about tracing the case history of a killer","by 1979, when Ballet Theater last presented ""Undertow,"" the ballet seemed out of step with a new era.

For history's neglected kids, it can be downright annoying.   So when Susan Mitchell, editor of a newsletter called The Boomer Report, noticed recently that the Census Bureau had abruptly lowered its projections of the population, for the rest of this decade, of people born between July 1, 1946, and July 1, 1947 -- from 3.8 million to 2.8 million -- she wondered: Was the agency onto stirrings of revolt?

Within days, the bombing had been tightly woven into the sprawling conspiracy theories that have obsessed some Americans since the beginning of the Republic. The historian Richard Hofstadter coined the phrase ""the paranoid style in American politics"" to describe this pathological world view in which history is a Manichean struggle between the forces of light and of darkness. The conspiratorial fantasies are not simply an expression of inchoate fear. There is a shape, an architecture, to the paranoia. The Nation",The Conspiracy That Never Ends,1990

From the flattened O of his mouth, the word ""murderer"" erupted in a regular rhythm, the repetition of the r's giving the word the sound of an outboard motor that failed to catch.   She, for her part, paced up and down directly in front of him, saying nothing. Instead, she held high a large cardboard sign on a stick, showing the cartoonish drawing of a bloody coat hanger over the caption, ""Never again."" Like his, her face was taut with fury, her lips pressed together so tightly they folded under and vanished.

1993,"No matter what else you might say about ""The Wiz,"" the all-black 1974 musical based on L. Frank Baum's classic, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"" it is an ebullient family crowd-pleaser. And a new production at the Beacon Theater, directed by George Faison and starring Stephanie Mills and Andre De Shields from the original Broadway cast, demonstrates that it doesn't take much to refresh the show, which ran on Broadway for four years. All that's needed is an infusion of contemporary slang and choreography (including a little Michael Jackson moonwalking and sexy L. L. Cool J-style pushups) to bring it up to date.   ""The Wiz"" takes a story so familiar that it doesn't have to be meticulously told to be followed, and reconceives it as a modern vaudeville entertainment with a pop-gospel score. The show is much jollier in tone than the movie ""The Wizard of Oz,"" which conveyed deep currents of Depression-era anxiety and longing for better times. Stephanie Mills's Dorothy has more pluck and brass than Judy Garland's waifish prairie dreamer. And while Ms. Mills's traveling companions on the Yellow Brick Road bemoan their lack of brains, heart and courage, the show's Scarecrow, Tinman and Lion are not so poignantly bereft of self-confidence as their movie counterparts.

2006,"INTERNATIONAL   A3-13    Bush Making Push at Home And Abroad for Iraq Efforts  Seeking political momentum from his surprise trip to Baghdad, President Bush warned Democrats that an early withdrawal of troops would set back counterterrorism efforts, and promised to send American diplomats to press countries to make good on $13 billion in pledges toward rebuilding Iraq.   A1    On the first day of the new government's security regime in Baghdad, soldiers and police officers took up positions, while Iraqis went about their business, wondering what, if anything, would be different.   A13    Afghans' Release Sought  An Afghan government delegation to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, said about half of the 94 Afghans being held there were not guilty of serious crimes and should be released.   A12    After the three suicides at Guantánamo, the respectful reception for a former detainee, Moazzam Begg -- whom the Pentagon still portrays as a terrorist -- is one of many markers of the waning credibility of Washington's detention policies.   A1    Palestinians Protest Back Pay  Palestinian civil servants stormed the parliament building in the West Bank demanding back pay, in the second violent protest this week at parliament, underscoring growing pressure on the Hamas government on several fronts.   A10    Offer to Iran Omitted Penalties  When a formal incentives package by the six powers to encourage Iran to curb its nuclear program was presented in writing in Tehran, it omitted a long list of potential punishments should Iran reject it, according to senior officials familiar with the package.   A3    NATIONAL   A14-21    Officials Seeking Source Of Lethal Heroin Mixture  Police and health authorities are struggling to track down the source of a doctored, intensely powerful heroin that has killed many in and around Chicago and Detroit and sent hundreds more to hospitals in cities from St. Louis to Philadelphia.   A14    Wealthier to Displace the Poor  Federal housing officials said over 5,000 public housing apartments for the poor are to be demolished in New Orleans and replaced by developments for residents with a wider range of incomes.   A16    Rove Decision Relieves Bush  President Bush said he ''took a sigh of relief'' when federal prosecutors decided this week not to indict Karl Rove, his top political adviser, in the C.I.A. leak case. Mr. Bush voiced full support for Mr. Rove, but otherwise declined to go into the details of the investigation.   A19    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Genetics to Explain Behavior  Studies that suggest a connection between DNA makeup and certain behaviors are causing many people to blame genetics for their shortcomings. Genes seem to influence whether a person is fat, for example, has a gift for dance or may become addicted to cigarettes.   A1    Bush Plans National Monument  President Bush will create the world's largest protected marine area, designating as a national monument a 1,200-mile chain of small Hawaiian islands and surrounding waters and reefs that are home to a spectacular array of sea life, senior administration officials said last night.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-8    Rampage Followed Attack In Subway, Police Say  A man suspected of stabbing a tourist from Texas on a downtown C train then went on a 13-hour rampage through Manhattan, the police said, plunging a knife into three more people and terrorizing workers at a late-night grocery store. He was arrested after a doorman and cabbies who had seen one of the attacks called 911 on their cellphones as they followed him.   A1    Ruling on 9/11 Detentions  A federal judge in Brooklyn ruled that the government has wide latitude under immigration law to detain noncitizens on the basis of religion, race or national origin, and to hold them indefinitely without explanation. But the judge allowed the class-action lawsuit that prompted the ruling -- filed by Muslim immigrants detained after 9/11 -- to continue on other claims.   B1    Crime Rises, but Not in City  Violent crime rose last year in cities and even in some quiet suburbs in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut region, according to preliminary statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The increases were such that New York City, which saw decreases in violent crime and murders, appeared to be an oasis of relative calm.

A1    BUSINESS DAY   C1-15    Inflation Worries Analysts  When the government reported that the core measure of consumer prices edged up 0.3 percent in May and was up 2.4 percent from 12 months earlier, analysts greeted the numbers as uniformly bad -- a far cry from how such news would have been viewed in decades past.
