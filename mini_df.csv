First off, it's handy to have a sprinkle of Chanelisms to toss in for flavor. (Outright copies come in handy, too.) For fall, a seasoning of vintage Courreges spices things up considerably as well. True creativity is great, but most good ideas have a cachet of times past. It takes courage to make a conversation piece, but sometimes it is what gives a designer's collection charisma. Comfort may sound colorless, but often it is what clinches the sale of clothes to a satisfied customer. (Let there be more of her!)

After one season as a special-teams player, though, Tardits - who says he was attracted to the American game because of the ''VEE-o-lance'' - has become so dangerous a pass rusher that the other day Vince Dooley was led to announce a ''battlefield promotion,'' and in a manner that was unprecedented in Dooley's quarter-century as Georgia coach. The 6-foot-2-inch, 225-pound defensive end had already recorded four sacks and otherwise harassed Bulldog quarterbacks throughout a spring scrimmage at Sanford Stadium when Dooley suddenly halted the proceedings, strolled out onto the field and called the entire team together.

New York State increased aid for prekindergarten programs this year from $9 million to $14 million, and half- day kindergarten classes in New York City were lengthened to a full day. Five states recently enacted laws making kindergarten attendance compulsory, and the legislatures of a dozen others, including Connecticut, are considering similar measures.    Gordon M. Ambach, the Commissioner of Education in New York, and Gerald Tirozzi, his counterpart in Connecticut, recently endorsed the idea of starting formal schooling at the age of 4 rather than 6, the current practice.    'A Question of Equity'      The emerging focus on early childhood education is a product of several forces, including the current wave of education legislation in virtually every state. ''Most of the focus thus far has been on high schools,'' said Michael Kirst, a professor of education at Stanford University.

2006,"IN    The News -- Charles G. Taylor, perhaps the most wanted fugitive in Africa, was arrested after fleeing his home in Nigeria, where he had lived in exile.    Behind the News -- Mr. Taylor was brought to Sierra Leone and is expected to face war crimes charges in connection with a civil war in that country, one of several he sparked. The government of Liberia, where Mr. Taylor ruled in the late 1990's, requested his arrest but wanted no part of him. Neither did anyone else: Sierra Leone asked the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands to provide a venue for the trial.    OUT    The News -- Jill Carroll, a freelance reporter for The Christian Science Monitor, was released three months after being kidnapped in Iraq.    Behind the News -- Little was known about the group that released her, the Revenge Brigade, and there were even doubts as to whether it was the same group that had kidnapped her in Baghdad in January, killing her translator in the process. Ms. Carroll herself could shed little light, saying she had not known where she was held and had been almost completely cut off from the outside world.    IN    The News -- Prosecutors in Belarus said they would bring charges against a jailed opposition candidate who led a protest against the results of recent elections.    Behind the News -- The action was one more step in the crackdown against the opposition by President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, who was re-elected March 19 in a vote Western governments and institutions say was marked by widespread fraud. His move was also one more snub of the West: the European Union and the United States had demanded that the opposition candidate, Aleksandr V. Kazulin, be released.    OUT    The News -- An Afghan man who was jailed for converting to Christianity was released and granted asylum in Italy.    Behind the News -- Although he had never been formally charged, the convert, Abdul Rahman, had faced possible execution after being accused of abandoning Islam. The Bush administration had pressed for his release. The case highlights the difficulty that Afghanistan faces in balancing democracy and religion: the country's new Constitution ensures religious freedom but also states that Islamic law is supreme.    IN AND OUT    The News -- The model Naomi Campbell was charged with assault at a Manhattan police station after a housekeeper accused her of throwing a cellphone at her.    Behind the News -- Ms. Campbell, 35, has been accused of this sort of behavior before -- including a 1998 incident, when she was arrested in Toronto and charged with assaulting an assistant. She pleaded guilty then. Prosecutors requested bail but Ms. Campbell was released on her own recognizance after her lawyer argued that it would be difficult for her to flee, given that she has one of the most famous faces in the world.
