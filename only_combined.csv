1926,1920,"A new aspirant for Tom Mix's audiences, named Ken Maynard, is introduced in a picture entitled ""Señor Daredevil,"" which is sojourning at the Colony. As the wages of a cowboy are nominal it is no wonder that occasionally a rough-rider should take a chance before the camera, especially when he hears that Mr. Mix's income is something like $2,000 a day. Mr. Maynard is good-looking and he rides so well that he makes extraordinary feats of horsemanship look comparatively simple. This vehicle, however, is not conspicuous for its originality and therefore it does not give Mr. Maynard much opportunity to show his ability as an actor. Nevertheless, in these hectic film days a prepossessing appearance is half the battle when a man has a horse he can ride, and Mr. Maynard, like Mr. Mix, has an animal called Tarzan who insists on getting his way in this yarn.This Señor Daredevil has an Irish father and a Mexican mother. They have been separated for years, owing to the incompatibility of temperaments. Daredevil's real name is Don Luis O'Flagherty, but having lived with his maternal relative most of his life he speaks like a Latin. When Tarzan insists that the young man shall ride him and not the other horse, this Don Luis O'Flagherty is quoted as saying:""You no want me to ride heem.""The plot of this Western effusion deals with a place called Goldstrike and bandits who want to starve out the Claimholders so that they can get the land for next to nothing. Food trains are constantly robbed and finally the ring leader of the rascals is put in charge of the community. Daredevil's father is ousted from the job and it is the dapper son, who first appears dressed like a bull-fighter off duty, that handles the situation so that the stakeholders come into their own.Herein are some effective scenes of a pack train going up and down a dangerous mountain trail. Mr. Maynard soon gets into the good graces of the heroine, which is no wonder, seeing that he is sufficiently resourceful to outwit the bandits and tie up some of them in sacks.Dorothy Devore lends her presence to the leading feminine rôle. That veterean screen actor, George Nichols, does well with the part of Daredevil's father. A New Rough Rider. "

1928,1920,"From the standpoint of its narrative, Emil Jannings's latest picture, ""The Last Command,"" now at the Rialto Theatre, is one of the most, satisfactory of shadow stories. It is logical throughout. It was inspired by the experiences of a Russian General, who fled to this country after the revolution in his own land. This production has its forced moments, its sluggish incidents, but the chronicle is equipped with a double strain of suspense. It strikes one as a good short story turned to excellent account in film form. It is a far more plausible account than that of ""The Way of All Flesh,"" but in the older picture the detail was more carefully filmed than that of ""The Last Command.""This current offering has a clever finish, an ending that is particularly skillfully devised, and one that is most effective. And if there are moments when Mr. Jannings holds the same expression and pose too long, you are rewarded for the most part with a brilliant performance in which there is a wealth of imagination. In the closing scenes Mr. Jannings gives a highly gifted and gripping portrayal of the last moments of the bent and bowed czarist generalissimo working as an extra in a motion picture studio. You see General Dolgorucki meet his death in the same uniform he wore with pomp and confidence of his high office before the red flag flew from Moscow's Kremlin, and the fiddle, a piano and a cello are rendering the old Russian National anthem.Just before the General crumples up on the salt-covered barbed-wire battleground of the studio, he hears his militant hymn and the director, a Russian who had no reason to love the General, gave the old man the words of comfort that caused the extra, in his unbalanced mental state, to believe that the Russia that was had come into power again.Mr. Jannings does not wear a cap in this scene, as he realized that it would conceal to a certain extent his various expressions. He is magnificent as he straightens up at the sound of his militant hymn and then drops to the studio ""snow.""""He was a great actor, that old guy,"" observes the casting director.""And a great man, which is more,"" I adds the picture director, who incidentally in Russia had felt the General's riding crop on his cheek.The motion picture end of this feature is wonderfully good, even to the selection of the players. There are the ""yes men,"" the light experts, the electric wires like eels around the studio floor. The instructions are done to a T, without anything being too extravagant. The story opens up with the choosing of a General for the battle scene, and Dolgorucki's photograph is brought out. It results in his selection and soon the casting director's assistant is on the wire calling Dolgorucki on the telephone at his shabby abode. He is told to report at 6:30 the next morning.As the broken Russian military commander, Jannings gives a hint of the man's sufferings. He wears a beard. His face is that of an aristocrat, but every half second he shakes his head, like a man suffering from shell shock. They gibe him about this in the studio and scoff at him when he tells them, the other extras, that the Czar gave him his military cross. Jannings is perceived gazing at his make-up box, the cover of which is a mirror. He looks, every so often shaking his head. Then comes a fade-out and soon one sees the General as he had been before the Kerensky or Soviet days. He is a man of courage, one who may use his riding crop occasionally, but who is not cruel. He loves his fatherland and even sneers at the Czar for taking a division of troops, from the battle front to satisfy the Little Father's vanity.More might have been accomplished with these Russian scenes to give a better idea of the General. His style appears to be cramped at times, for while one is told that he is a cousin of the Czar and commander of the Russian armies, be does not appear to be doing much more than the work of a captain.There is pictured the flaring up of the rabble, and Jannings is shown with swollen lips, blood-smeared, standing against a wall of a railway station. In some of these flashes Mr. Jannings—who, as the General, admittedly has suffered frightful punishment—could nevertheless have shown in his eyes some fire when the men and women goad him and spit water in his face. His strength may have been ebbing, but he now and again lifts some coal to the locomotive's fire, and subsequently he musters up enough strength to bang the locomotive driver over the head with a shovel, and then to leap from the locomotive to the snow. But it is Mr. Jannings's splendid work that causes one to want just a bit more. He lives the character and the most trifling shortcoming makes one wonder at it.After the chapters in Russia, wherein there is qute a good portrait of the last Czar, the story goes back to the studio.Evelyn Brent is pleasing as a girl who helps the General. William Powell gives a sterling portrait of a motion picture director and also as one of the ringleaders of the infuriated mob. THE SCREEN Desert Fights."

1923,1920,"Let the drums of Fate sound as loud as they will, they cannot arouse the echo of smiles, laughter and applause called forth by the quiet little film, ""Fruits of Faith,"" in which Will Rogers, his baby and a mule take possession of the program at the Rialto this week. After you have sat through the featured photoplay, you come to this real feature of the bill. It's only some two or three reels long and it makes no pretentions as to plot or magnificence of setting. It probably cost less than one reel of the intercontinental concoction which precedes it. But there is more genuine entertainment in any hundred feet of it than in all the celluloid mile of agony and adventure that prolongs the heavy hour of the photoplay.""In this ""Fruits of Faith"" Will Rogers enters as a hobo without particular destination and only a general location somewhere west of the cactus line. He has only one problem in life—how to eat and at the same time avoid work. He is successful at once so far as work is concerned. He just won't, and that's all there is to it. But the problem of eating is not so easily solved—until an itinerant preacher brings the message of faith. He says, in effect, ""If you don't see what you want, pray for it,"" and the tramp decides to give the thing a trial. He prays for food and the paper bag in which a passing stranger is carrying groceries bursts open at his feet.And so on through some twenty or thirty minutes of slender story made human and humorous by the humanness and humor of Will Rogers. There would be little or nothing to the picture without him, of course—that is, without him and the baby and the mule. He finds the other two in the desert and adopts them. And he has ways of his own with both. Although the baby is not named on the program it is Mr. Rogers's own. No one has said so, but any strange child handled the way Rogers bundles this husky youngster about would certainly register long and continuous objections. The little quadruped in the picture enjoys it, however. He's been used to it ever since he was born, probably, and would wonder what was the matter if, for example, he was carried any other way than by the back of his belt, hanging down like a traveling bag.At the end the picture becomes somewhat moral and sentimental, but only briefly and to a moderate degree, not enough to dull the points of its humor, nor those of its satire, or banter, either.""Drums of Fate,"" the photoplay mentioned, and passed over, above, is about a supercivilized girl who loves big men and strong and marries one, an African explorer with a thick mustache, but commits bigamy by marrying a crippled musician when she receives the false news of her first husband's death at the hands of savages. Husband No. 1 turns up again, of course, but dashes back into the jungle when he finds his place occupied. The musician dies, however, and then the girl is free to follow her true lord into the camp of musical comedy savages with whom he has sought to escape from the world. The only real acting in the piece is done by Fawcett, who doesn't have much of a chance as the girl's guardian, and Casson Ferguson, who makes the most of the musician's r$#244 le.Also at the Rialto is another Music Film in Prizma colors, a pleasant little bit of ""The Mirror"" dance done by the Fairbanks Twins.

1941,1940,"Some fine reportorial films have come from England since this war began—films such as ""London Can Take It"" and ""Christmas Under Fire""—which have conveyed in graphic details a sense of the courage and strength of the British under fire. But no film that they have sent over—and, in fact, no film about this war yet made—has surpassed, or can even equal, the extraordinary British document, ""Target for Tonight,"" which arrived in this country only last week and which went on view at the Globe yesterday.Here is one picture you may be certain no Hollywood production can ever touch, though many may try in the future, at great and elaborate expense. For this one was taken directly in the midst of this war's activity. It was made by the Crown Film Unit under the direction of Harry Watt, with men of the R. A. F., from Air Marshal Sir Richard Peirse down to the lowest mechanic, as its only actors. And it has been made with such fine and intelligent restraint, fashioned so simply and directly and photographed with such artistry that it constitutes both a brilliant motion picture and a splendid tribute to a wonderful bunch of men.""Target For Tonight"" is the authentic story of a bombing raid on Germany—a simple, factual account of how such a raid is planned and how it is executed, from the moment when a reconnoissance plane drops a picture of the target until the following fog-shrouded dawn when the last of the bombers—""F for Freddie""—comes roaring home to its base. It shows the manner in which the Bomber Command lays out its operations, how instructions are transmitted to the squadrons which are to participate, how the plan of attack is ""briefed"" by the men of one particular squadron and then how the crew of one powerful Wellington conducts its appointed task.This is but the structure of the picture. The true, thrilling quality of it lies in the remarkable human detail which Mr. Watt has worked into it—the quiet, efficient way in which each man goes about his job the interjection of humor which even the grimmest task and danger cannot suppress, and finally the tremendous suspense of the routine bombing attack when we ride with the crew of ""F for Freddie"" and get the feeling of being one of them. Mr. Watt has a fine eye for color, and his camera is used with eloquence. There is not a waste shot in this picture; not one that fails to carry a sharp effect.Of them all, we will mention only one as a token of his sure dramatic sense. The lads of the bomber squadron have donned their flying togs in a small room and then have gone trooping out to board their planes, like prep school boys to play a game. The hubbub and confusion suddenly cease; the room is empty and still. But Mr. Watt holds his camera upon it—on scattered chairs and open locker doors. In that brief moment you feel the lurking fate which these young men have gone to face and a sense of their great but casual courage rushes over you.""Target For Tonight"" is a picture which quickens the pulse and cheers the heart. ' Target for Tonight,' a Fine Fact Film About the R.A.F., at the Globe -- Comedy at Central"

As the Pentagon's own official study of events in Lebanon has now made clear:     * It was Mr. Reagan's policy that sent the Marines into the crossfire of international, religious and historical forces in Lebanon; and it was his definition of their role as that of a ''peacekeeping force'' with a mission of ''limited duration'' that essentially disarmed them - psychologically as well as literally. Even after two marines were killed and 14 were wounded last August 29, Mr. Reagan steadfastly refused to concede, in the language of the War Powers Act, that he had sent forces ''into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances''; nor has he done so yet.

The release of the 17-pound female near a rock-strewn ridge in this heavily wooded section of Passaic County was part of the state's continuing effort to restock wilderness areas with some of the animals that once were common.

The aim is to inject an $70 billion into the third world during 1984 and 1985 to finance an increase in economic growth to 5 percent a year.

Even though the plant would not cost the Five Towns taxpayers any money, some residents were less than supportive of the proposal, citing the experience of those in Hempstead, where a different type of garbage- burning plant became unusable for several years with problems of odors and dioxin. 

Under the proposed plan for the Five Towns, a $20 million pyrolysis plant would be built off Rockaway Turnpike in North Lawrence, on a site formerly occupied by an incinerator that was closed in 1979 after failing to meet state and Federal environmental standards.

As the machinists union agreed to company demands to reduce wages but refused to make further changes in work rules or benefits, Frank Lorenzo, president of Texas Air Corporation, and a man widely regarded as hostile to labor, made a takeover offer the Eastern board agreed it could not refuse.

Judge Claude M. Hilton of the Eastern District of Virginia delayed a ruling on a request by two banks that he appoint a receiver to oversee the mortgage company's operations.

Ganden is old and in ruins, but these are not old ruins: This 15th-century monastery, the third largest in Tibet, was destroyed only 17 years ago.   Ganden was founded in 1409 by Tsong Kha-pa, an austere man of fantastic intellect who created what remains to this day the dominant sect of Tibetan Buddhism and who counted among his pupils the first Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal leader of Tibetans. Over the centuries Ganden became a vast university for thousands of scholars, with a dozen colleges in fields as diverse as philosophy and medicine, yoga and architecture, grammar and dance. It was a place of spirited debates over the great texts of Buddhism, sometimes attended by the Dalai Lama, who rode out on horseback to Ganden. VISITING A TIBETAN MONESTARY"

The public is by now accustomed to hearing dry statistics about the immense destructiveness of nuclear war, but many people probably assume that afterward the uninjured survivors would pick up the pieces, and the wounded would be tended as they have been after every other war.

It referred to what a columnist for the paper called ''an unfurling of superfluous messages and excessive sorrows'' that followed the death Thursday of Thierry Le Luron, a popular 34-year-old nightclub comedian whose specialty consisted of uncannily accurate caricatures of France's political figures.   Le Monde's columnist, Daniele Heymann, was about the only commentator here on the day after Mr. Le Luron's death to note the exaggerated and deeply emotional effect that the event had on French society, which treated it with degrees of bereavement and attention worthy of the passing of a head of state or a giant of literature.   Mr. Le Luron, a slight, boyish man popular here for the last decade or so, was known, among other things, for his creation of a character called Adolphe-Benito Glandu. The character was a rightist bigot full of rancor whom he lampooned with savage effect - in so doing lampooning as well a certain prototype of the ordinary Frenchman from the provinces largely untouched by the values of the Enlightenment.

1986,1980,"In the wake of the broad success of home centers - the large hardware and building supply stores that revolutionized the do-it-yourself industry - an even bigger type of retailer started to appear in the early 1980's: the warehouse store.   Sprawled across 80,000 or more square feet, three times the size of the typical home center, the no-frills warehouses offered everything from screwdrivers to sheet rock at rock-bottom prices. They sprouted in many large urban areas around the country - jumping from 47 outlets in 1983 to an estimated 300 by the end of 1986 - and some analysts predicted that they would snare as much as 12 percent of the home repair and remodeling market by 1985 and 15 percent shortly thereafter.   But while the warehouses may have driven some home centers and neighborhood hardware stores out of business, their market share has not lived up to advance billing. With $3 billion in annual sales, the giant outlets now account for just 5 percent of the $60.1 billion market, and the current view is that their share will reach only 8 percent by 1990.

Perhaps the most striking thing about the two statewide races was the similarity of their results. The conventional wisdom, reinforced by polls by several candidates and independent organizations, was that the Senate race was very close, but the governor's race was not. Aides to Lewis B. Rome, the Republican nominee for governor, complained after the election that the polls that showed their man trailing by 21 points had the effect of drying up money that might otherwise have made victory possible.

1984,1980,"A review of estimates of possible radiation exposure from the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania has found contradictions and defective methods in the earlier studies.     The new review, released yesterday by Dr. Jan Beyea, a nuclear physicist and senior staff scientist at the National Audubon Society, said that earlier exposure estimates should not be considered final.   The two-year study was ''the first major independent review'' of earlier estimates of exposure, according to the Three Mile Island Public Health Fund, which commissioned it. That organization was established in 1981 as part of a settlement of suits against the nuclear plant's owner, General Public Utilities, after the accident.

1984,1980,"BOTH on Broadway in 1976 and Off Broadway now, in its loving revival at the Promenade, ''Pacific Overtures'' is a one-of-a-kind experiment in the annals of the musical theater.    At once a documentary and a vaudeville revue about a century or so of interstitched American and Japanese history, the show attempts an ironic marriage of Broadway and Oriental idioms in its staging, its storytelling techniques and, most of all, in its haunting Stephen Sondheim songs. It's a shotgun marriage, to be sure - with results that are variously sophisticated and simplistic, beautiful and vulgar. But if ''Pacific Overtures'' is never going to be anyone's favorite Sondheim musical, it is a far more forceful and enjoyable evening at the Promenade than it was eight years ago at the Winter Garden.

1983,1980,"When Arthur Hayes became commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in April 1981, he jettisoned nearly all of the Carter Administration's ambitious mandatory labeling plans for a variety of food ingredients and began a vigorous public relations drive against one - sodium.

Now he says that an increasing number of manufacturers are going along with his voluntary program, which involves labeling all products with the amount of sodium they contain.

''At last count, about 20 percent'' of processed food products carry sodium labeling, ''and we are confident that this figure will have increased to one-third by mid-1983,'' he said in mid-February.At the outset of the voluntary program in 1981, sodium labeling was at 13 percent, he said.

1981,1980,"When you push somebody out of a window, how would you describe the sound the person makes as he heads for the asphalt 40 stories below?  The answer, as any reader of old comic books will quickly tell you, is ''Aieeeee!'' -sometimes spelled ''Aiiieeeee!'' It is the nearest written approximation of a scream -not perfect, but an improvement over ''Eek!,'' which is now used exclusively by people leaping on chairs to escape mice. A strangled scream is spelled ''Arrgh!''   These thoughts on how to transmit grunts (ugh!) and sounds that make sense but are not words (hunh?) come to mind in an investigation of the origin of a sound word that is beginning to make it as a real word:''zap.''   To zap someone is ''to let him have it'' - to strike as if by thunderbolt. The verb has been used to mean ''to increase speed,'' as in this citation from Time magazine in 1967: ''Nickel-cadmium batteries ... could zap the car from a standstill to 50 miles per hour in 20 seconds.'' As a noun, ''zap'' is sometimes confused with ''zip,'' which means ''pep, sparkle, vivacity,'' but since the mid-1970's, both noun and verb have denoted the action of a swift shot in the teeth, actual or metaphoric.

In midafternoon, the pattern reversed. First, there was the random return of women to their homes, then the rumble of school buses with gangs of chattering youngsters spilling unceremoniously onto the streets, the front lawns and backyards. Much later, as the angle of light dims, a dark tide of returning commuters appears, swelling the streets once again with vehicles amid the clatter of women preparing dinner, and ending at last in the hypnotic twilight of the cocktail hour.

Because currencies often skip about, even more than equities, investors realize that they can substantially increase their returns if they gear their investments to exchange-rate expectations. But if they are too bold, instead of making a fortune, they can lose a fortune.   There is no reason, however, for an investor not to pay at least some attention to dollar trends.

To many of them, it still does, but they're getting used to the idea.   The reason: Aaron Ziegelman. Mr. Ziegelman, a major building converter who specializes in what he calls ''next-to-emerge neighborhoods,'' came here two-and-a-half years ago with his partner, William K. Langfan, and began buying, renovating and converting old apartment buildings that had seen little investment for many years.

President Reagan adopted the same goal last month, but because of economic conditions and the President's decision not to make dramatic cuts in the military buildup, the Administration package now projects a $140 billion deficit that year.   Another $1.1 billion was added to the President's proposed budget when Agriculture Secretary John R. Block won delays and modifications in the plan to cut farm price supports. (Page 7.)

1985,1980,"Slowly, the Knicks' intriguing picture is beginning to take form. This afternoon, between the fifth and sixth practice sessions of camp, the team announced the signing of the free-agent center Bill Cartwright to a contract that will pay him an average of $1.2 million annually over the next six seasons.   The first five years of the pact are guaranteed, which is a victory of sorts for the 28-year-old player and his attorney, Bob Woolf. They had originally asked for a guarantee of six years, while the Knicks, fearful that the twice-broken foot that forced Cartwright to miss all of last season might recur, offered to guarantee only one season. But over this past weekend, the desire to have Cartwright in camp as soon as possible was enough to impel the Knick vice president, Dave DeBusschere, to agree to a five-year guarantee. The signing was also slowed by the restrictions of the salary cap, which forced the team to come to terms with Patrick Ewing, the rookie, before Cartwright. KNICKS SIGN CARTWRIGHT TO 6-YEAR PACT "

1984,1980,"WE ARE OFTEN asked about how a food column originates. Do you, some wonder, spend time each week plotting what will appear the following one? No. What appears here is, for the most part, spontaneous. If, for example, one of us sees an item in a store that seems particularly toothsome, we make a mental note of it. Pierre telephones me at 8:45 A.M. each working day, and one or the other of us says, ''The mushrooms (or the cauliflower or the ducks or the salmon or whatever) look especially good.'' Over the phone, we detail a shopping list, foods we instinctively know will be compatible with the main ingredient. Within minutes of Pierre's arrival with the foodstuffs, he is at the stove and I am at a typewriter perched on an island in the kitchen. And then the improvisation starts. There is no longer any such thing as a consummately original, shake-the-foundations recipe.  That is not to say new recipes are not developed. It is to say that the foundations of cookery have all been laid down and what the most creative among us do is to make variations of something that has gone before. When we start, we decide the form the food will take. As the day progresses, we make the choice for the major basic ingredient, the ground meat for a meat loaf, say. Then we decide on flavors. Perhaps a bit of marjoram. And we proceed from there with the bread crumbs, beaten egg and so on. STUFFED MUSHROOMS "

1984,1980,"Until recently, one could reasonably hope that post-Tito Yugoslavia was moving gradually toward democratization. The main evidence was an increasing latitude for discussion of political issues in the press.

 Now, however, the situation has taken a serious turn toward repression. It began with seizures in recent months of whole issues of newspapers and journals carrying articles deemed critical of the regime and the system. Then, on the evening of April 20, the government took a giant step toward silencing political discussion, arresting 28 Yugoslavs of diverse political views as they met in a Belgrade living room to hear a talk on nationalist problems by Milovan Djilas, the grand old man of political dissent in East Europe.

But in August, members of the board of education, concerned about student alcohol and drug abuse, took an extraordinary step, voting to require all of the school's 500 students to take blood and urine tests, which, among other things, would be used to detect drug use and alcohol abuse. Under the new policy, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, the physical exam would be mandatory, and any student who refused to undergo one would be excluded from school. The results of the tests would be confidential and would not be turned over to the police, school officials said.   The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey challenged the policy in court, and a State Superior Court judge temporarily barred the school from beginning the tests until the suit could be decided.

First, on a note of optimism, the Syrian victor may not be as strong as he appears: A power struggle is now going on in Damascus among Hafez al-Assad, his brother, Rifaat, and the army commander.

1982,1980,"To many who watched last night's news conference from the White House, the reporters seemed more aggressive, even emotional, and their questions on economic policy and the Middle East more hostile than usual in the 20-month Presidency of Ronald Reagan.   But rather than any sudden worsening of relations between the President and the press, the unusually sharp tone last night appeared to be a result of the particular circumstances that shaped Mr. Reagan's 13th televised news conference, according to longtime observers of the institution.   That and the fact that many scholars, Government officials and journalists have long held that the Presidential news conference, because it is televised nationally and is usually limited to one-half hour every month or so, is frequently more theater than an instrument for conveying information.   ''The fact of the matter is it isn't a news conference,'' said Hugh Sidey of Time Magazine, a veteran White House observer, on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' program this morning.

1985,1980,"To many spiders, the web is everything.   For the approximately 15,000 species of web-building spiders, most of them nearly blind, the web is their essential window on the world: their means of communicating, capturing prey, meeting mates and protecting themselves. A web-building spider without its web is like a man marooned on an island of solid rock, totally out of touch and destined to starve to death. A fly could walk unmolested right under the nose of a webless spider.   Perhaps no one knows this better than Dr. Peter N. Witt, a physician-pharmacologist who 37 years ago was seduced into a career-long study of spiders and their silken domiciles. In 1948 a frustrated zoologist at the University of Tubingen in West Germany turned to his pharmacologist colleague for help in photographing orb-web spiders in the process of constructing their homes. The spiders normally perform this task in the dark around 5 A.M., which is not exactly ideal for movie making.

Mr. Allison, as pianist and singer, combined aspects of both -the Delta blues singers he had listened to first-hand in Mississippi and the jazz musicians such as Louis Armstrong and Nat (King) Cole that he heard primarily on records.   He established himself playing and singing in a gentle, understated way, in a narrow range and using a bouncing, jigging rhythm that was closely related to the so-called ''swamp music'' that the clarinetist Jimmy Giuffre was playing.

When redoing an overgrown planting keep in mind that small trees and shrubs will look out of place in established plantings, such as those that surround an older home. Within 15 or 20 years after a house has been built and the neighborhood developed, the plantings will have taken on a degree of maturity.

Predictably, Mr. Weicker and his allies claim that he, not Prescott Bush Jr., the former State Republican finance director, is more electable in a matchup this fall with the Democratic nominee, Representative Toby Moffett.

They also maintain that any Republican hope of winning the Governor's mansion, a goal last achieved during my tenure as state party chairman 12 years ago, rests with Mr. Weicker being the Republican nominee.

Any dispassionate look at the facts suggests, however, that Mr.  Bush, not Mr. Weicker, is more electable in 1982 - that Mr. Bush, not Mr. Weicker, is the best hope for electing other Republicans, including a governor. BUSH SHOULD BE G.O.P.'S CHOICE "

What was, in September, a lush jungle of cucumbers and beans, melons, peppers and eggplants, is now a sparse grassland. And rising in its midst is the compost heap - a great burial mound.

If the day is soft, these precious gifts will be delivered in the park behind our house on a lovely bank of the Potomac less than two miles from the Pentagon, and I will experience deep parental joy but also grave doubt that I have lived up to my obligations as a father in the nuclear age.   Surely I have done those things that elicit children's love. I have displayed affection; held jobs, paid money as required and then paid some more; listened; answered as best I could; attended Important Events; transmitted values, and loved without reservation. As a black man, I have been lucky - as millions of black fathers have not. I have always had a job, and predictable income makes transmission of middle-class values and the gift of stress-free, guilt-free love easy. Two Kinds Of Arms"
1986,1980,"The true operatic stature of Ghena Dimitrova, who appeared here Tuesday night in a Pittsburgh Opera production of Verdi's ''Macbeth,'' must remain a question mark for Metropolitan Opera audiences until next season when she is scheduled to sing the title role in Puccini's ''Turandot.'' Although the Bulgarian soprano has been a familiar figure in the major European houses for many years, New York knows her only from concert versions of ''Nabucco'' and ''La Gioconda,'' where the rare power and thrust of her voice aroused great enthusiasm. These same performances also aroused doubts as to her importance as a singing actress.   In her concert appearances, Miss Dimitrova tended to strike monumental attitudes and rely on a big, granitic tone whose impact could not be denied. One listened with fading hope, however, for liquid Italianate phrasing and the kind of direct connection between music and text that marks the feeling, thinking vocal artist. The question was whether in an actual operatic staging, under a strong director, Miss Dimitrova's artistic juices would be stimulated to flow more freely. MUSIC: PITTSBURGH OPERA'S 'MACBETH' "

 CHIMON ISLAND, 70 acres of sand and scrub popular with at least nine species of wading birds and generations of Norwalk beachgoers, was brought two steps closer last week to designation as a national wildlife refuge.

The action centered on the United States House of Representatives, where Stewart B. McKinney, a Westport Republican who recalls taking day sails to Chimon as a teen-ager, and William R. Ratchford, a Danbury Democrat who years ago spent summers at the shore, pressed for government purchase of that island and other Long Island Sound parcels to form the Chimon Island National Wildlife Refuge.

Mr. McKinney was the lead witness Thursday at a hearing before the Fisheries, Wildlife Conservation and the Environment Subcommittee on a bill he introduced last April to establish the refuge. Mr. Ratchford, a member of the Appropriations Committee, urged passage Tuesday and Thursday of a bill containing a $2.5 million provision he inserted to buy the properties.

''The early signs are encouraging,'' said Mr. Ratchford. ''Stu's been working on the authorizing committee level, and I'll continue to work on the appropriation.

Thirty years ago Dr. Masters, a prominent gynecologist, was authorized by Washington University in St. Louis to establish a laboratory to study the physiology of human sexual response.   Twenty-five years ago he and his psychologist colleague, chosen in part for the confidence she inspired in patients, introduced the medical profession to ''the concepts and precepts of normal sexual functioning.'' These were gleaned from direct laboratory observation of hundreds of human sexual responses during coitus and masturbation. The findings of the daring studies, which included prostitutes and surrogate partners and, at once, shocked the public and illuminated an aspect of human functioning never before so intensively studied, were summarized in 1966 in somewhat murky scientific language in a best- selling landmark work, ''Human Sexual Response.'' 30 YEARS OF PIONEERING IN SEX THERAPY "

1985,1980,"A Federal judge ruled yesterday that the United States Government could not be forced to contribute to a $180 million fund to aid Vietnam War veterans who say they were harmed by Agent Orange.   But the judge held that while the Government ''is within its legal rights in refusing to contribute'' to the fund set up by Agent Orange manufacturers, its position ''may be cruel to the veterans who served their country and feel that the government has turned its back on them in this litigation.''   The judge, Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who has been presiding over the long and complex Agent Orange litigation, also said the Government's position ''may be shortsighted in its refusal to assist contractors who voluntarily produced at Government request what amounted to critical war supplies during a foreign crisis.''   Judge Weinstein declared: ''Undoubtedly, the United States will pay a high price for its present position. In the future many contractors will require indemnification, and increased insurance costs will be added to the price of the goods the Government purchases.

United States public opinion and the American Government have a valid point: Mexican exports of drugs are on the rise, and Mexico is, at least theoretically, in danger of becoming another Colombia or Thailand. Mexican drug-enforcement officials and agencies are, as elsewhere, largely allied to and bought off by the criminals they are meant to pursue. Nor are the links between drug traffickers and officials limited to low-level police officers on the take. The United States knows this so does Mexico. But neither knows what to do about it.

1986,1980,"Holiday Inns, the flagship product of the Holiday Corporation, are everywhere - and that is both the biggest asset and the biggest problem of the Memphis-based hotelier, the nation's largest.   With 318,000 rooms in sites as varied as Kankakee, Ill., and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Holiday is finding that so much penetration makes new growth difficult, if not impossible. Instead, the company has sought fresh life by building different types of hotels not carrying the Holiday name.   But it faces a tough battle: A domestic oversupply of rooms - one that industry executives expect to continue even if fear of terrorism and a weak dollar keep Americans home this summer - has made the going rough for all.   The pressure is not immediately obvious. The company's stock, often a clue to its well-being and its prospects, has been trading near its high of $70, closing yesterday at $68, down 87.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has been pushed up partly by the predictions of a burst in tourism in the United States, as well as by the company's higher earnings per share. Analysts complain, however, that the earnings growth has been fueled by sales of hotels, and not by continuing operations, despite the company's new efforts at expansion.

And it appeared that President Reagan, who just barely blocked Congress's attempts to enact trade restraints this year, will try to work with the legislators next year to produce a trade law.   ''This Administration is not about to embrace a protectionist modus operandi,'' said Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States' special trade representative.

1985,1980,"Prices for future delivery of crude oil and heating oil plunged on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, as oil traders predicted that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would be unable to prevent prices from crumbling further.   The prices were the lowest since crude oil began trading on the exchange in 1983 and heating oil began trading in 1978.    The dramatic drop in prices was the first clear reaction by the market to the OPEC conference last week in Geneva, and reflected doubts by many analysts and traders that the conference achieved anything.   In the first trading day since the conference ended Saturday, the price of crude oil to be delivered next month fell 49 cents a barrel, or more than a penny a gallon, to $25.92 a barrel. Virtually no crude oil traded hands yesterday in the spot markets, but if similar prices reign there they would be the lowest since the revolution in Iran pushed prices up at the end of 1979.

1986,1980,"Just south of the Nicaraguan border in northwestern Costa Rica, in an area of savannas, farmlands, pastures and devastated forest land, a scientific project is getting under way: the creation by man of a diverse and complex tropical forest.   The project is the dream of Dr. Daniel H. Janzen, a professor of biology at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on tropical forests. Wildlife experts say it is one of the most unusual and important biological experiments undertaken in the last several decades.   The project will create a 430-square-mile national park, the major part of which will consist of tropical dry forest areas. Remaining areas will be zoned for recreation, farming and other uses. The land, Guanacaste National Park, is named after the Costa Rican national tree and for the land's province. Much of the land for the park has already been purchased and zoned for a variety of uses.

So far, senior Administration officials say, President Reagan's major accomplishment has been to build momentum in military and domestic economic policy. Many officials attribute their having avoided lasting failures and catastrophes to this momentum, as well as to Mr. Reagan's good luck and Mr. Shultz's ability to heal breaches with friendly countries.     Now, with international problems simmering and with Presidential primaries not far off, the officials say Mr. Reagan and Mr. Shultz are looking for foreign policy successes. These could include arms control treaties with the Soviet Union, a workable policy in Central America, European support for new medium- range missile deployments in December and movement in Middle East talks beyond the Israeli-Lebanese troop withdrawal agreement.

When the fan attends a sporting event, the electricity in the crowd and the proximity of the action create a special and urgent intimacy. But on the tube, or on radio, that same event is unadorned by such intimacy, and those voices are needed to bridge the distance and, perhaps, to satisfy different expectations in the same fan.

Rebel leaders and American officials who monitor the guerrilla movement say the meeting will be the most far-reaching effort so far to reorganize the leadership of the anti-Sandinista guerrillas in an effort to expand their political appeal and military effectiveness.   The meeting appears to be the culmination of a long and politically damaging debate within the rebel movement over political objectives, and it appears to reflect a power struggle among top rebel leaders.

Mr. Ackerman raised $228,904 for his campaign for a special election earlier this year to succeed the late Benjamin S. Rosenthal in the House.

1986,1980,"RUBICON BEACH By Steve Erickson. 300 pp. New York: Poseidon Press. $15.95. 

IN his second novel, ''Rubicon Beach,'' Steve Erickson has shunned the strictures of realistic fiction to create a highly imaginative work whose true subject is the imagination itself. This is a book that draws heavily on the stuff of movies and other books, and it mixes a number of genres and influences with varying degrees of success. Part science fiction, part surrealist love story, part political fable, ''Rubicon Beach'' combines all these elements into something whose overall impact is curiously close to that of opera. The strong passages attain a stirring lyrical intensity the weak passages are by turns leaden and bombastic. One is inclined to forgive Mr. Erickson for his lapses, however, since he has taken on some ambitious themes, and such boldness can often lead a writer into dangerous waters. That he has largely managed to keep himself afloat is very much to his credit. ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TWILIGHT ZONE"

1986,1980,"On one recent afternoon, 11 Manila file folders were lined up neatly on a glass table in Mark Senak's office at the Gay Men's Health Crisis. Each one had a man's name written on the outside. On the inside, each one contained a newly drafted will, drawn up for someone with AIDS.   For most people, writing a will is a rite of passage, an unpleasant but routine acknowledgment of mortality. But in Mr. Senak's office above the galleries, bistros and boutiques of a resurgent Chelsea, the ritual seems almost unreal.

Edited by Ira Berlin.  Joseph P. Reidy and Leslie S. Rowland, associate editors.  Illustrated. 852 pp. New York: Cambridge University Press. $37.50.   MANCIPATION was a high moment in the history of the nation and for many the climactic event in the Civil War drama. It was also a shameful time and a rough experience for all concerned, especially the liberated. For them it combined elation, joy and hope with distress, humiliation and terror. W.E.B. Du Bois tried to capture the paradox in one of the many poetic passages of his classic ''Black Reconstruction'': ''A great human sob shrieked in the wind, and tossed its tears upon the sea, - free, free, free.''   More conventional historians treated the subject in the traditional way: going to the archives or some fraction of them and reporting to the reader their findings and impressions in narrative form. The present work is a departure from tradition. It lays before the reader the selected documents themselves, together with full narrative and interpretive introductions, and invites participation in the historian's search for meaning.

A contract to do the renovation, including some routine repairs, will likely be signed with Doubleday Sports, a company owned by Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon, who also own the Mets.

The Detroit Tigers, whose 104 regular-season victories indicated that they were the best team in the baseball this year, provided conclusive and irrefutable evidence today, winning the World Series with an 8-4 victory over the San Diego Padres.   Climaxing a season in which they were in first place in the American League East every single day, the Tigers roared past the Padres, four games to one, by once again demolishing a San Diego starting pitcher in the early innings and adding a late-inning touch of power.   Home Run Off Gossage    Kirk Gibson, who was treated so roughly by Detroit fans during a slump last year that he wanted to be traded by the Tigers, played the primary role in each instance, slugging two home runs halfway up the upper stands and driving in five runs.

1985,1980,"President Reagan's tax-revision plan presents the Democrats with a perfect opportunity to regain the political high ground. The Administration has worked hard to present the proposal as a populist revolt against special interests. And, over all, the President's plan is an improvement on the present system. But the substance of the proposal falls far short of its populist packaging.   In fact, in the name of economic ''incentives'' the President's plan would continue several tax breaks for traditional Republican constituencies. Moreover, within a few years it would produce significant revenue losses that would have to be made up, perhaps through a consumption tax. If the Democrats can redraw the reform package to conform truly to populist principles, they may succeed in regaining the allegiance of the ''Reagan Democrats'' - blue-collar, ethnic voters - whom Mr. Reagan seems so intent upon welding into the Republican coalition.

1985,1980,"''Shoah,'' at Cinema Studio 1 and 2, is Claude Lanzmann's huge, exhaustively researched and detailed film about the Holocaust, not as it is re-created through archival footage of the death camps, but as the death camps are remembered today. The ''witnesses to genocide'' include survivors and former Nazi officials who planned and operated the death camps, as well as German and Polish civilians, some of whom reveal feelings that are no better than mixed.   By remaining resolutely in the present, and dealing with the past as it is recalled in these hours of frequently repetitive and harrowing testimony, the film rediscovers the original horror of a chapter in history that time tends to make comprehensible. ''Shoah'' is more than exemplary reportage. It's one of the great documentary films of the last 30 years. Because of its unusual length (nearly nine and a half hours), the film is being shown in two parts, which are being presented simultaneously in the two Cinema Studio auditoriums.   MOVIES "

SIPC, as it is also called, is an insurance fund that provides each brokerage firm customer up to $500,000 in coverage for securities held by the firm and $100,000 for cash. At first glance, it seems like an ample cushion for investors. But on closer inspection, one gets concerned that this nation's securities insurance system would be inadequate to cope with a major brokerage house failure. 

All registered broker-dealers are mandatory members of SIPC and pay assessments to support the fund at a level now set at $300 million. In an emergency, SIPC can also draw up to $1 billion from the United States Treasury through the S.E.C., a line of credit that so far has not been used.

1985,1980,"A GREAT virtue of the Cornell University graduate program in history before the war was its informality. I was thus able to follow the dictates of my own spirit, and to an amazing degree. This was the situation into which ''A Study of History'' by Arnold J. Toynbee intruded. I well remember first catching sight of those three volumes, bound in bright green, nestling at eye level in one of the bays of the White Library. It was a completely random encounter: the books still smelled of fresh print, and had never been used before. Nor did I have the slightest idea of the experience that lay before me when I took them down from the shelves. What could be more noncommittal than ''A Study of History,'' with an unknown name on the spine? But I was soon engrossed.

1991,1990,"New York City will have to build as many as three new garbage incinerators, in part because it will not be able to recycle as much trash as state goals call for, the Dinkins administration has concluded.   The new incinerators could cost at least $1 billion and will most likely prompt fierce opposition from environmental and community groups. In his 1989 mayoral campaign, David N. Dinkins had held out hope that the city would be able to address its trash disposal needs without resorting to new incinerators.   But in a plan to be disclosed today, Dinkins administration officials acknowledge that in addition to expanding three existing plants, two to three additional new incinerators will be needed.  Burning Plus Recycling    The administration also said that the city would have to burn 68 percent of its trash, slightly less than what was contemplated by the Koch administration.  The city collects 14,500 tons of waste a day. ""Even with very aggressive recycling, we still need to burn 10,000 tons,"" Steven M. Polan, the city's Sanitation Commissioner, said in an interview yesterday.   Many environmental and community groups have vehemently opposed building new incinerators because of concern over worsening air quality and neighborhood disruption by truck traffic. Incinerators emit several kinds of contaminants including soot particles containing lead, acid gases and dioxin, considered to be health risks.    The city will be able to recycle 25 percent of its trash by the year 2000, the same level required by city law but less than a state goal of as much as 42 percent by 1997, Mr. Polan said.    But any more than 25 percent cannot be economically justified because recycling markets will not be sufficiently developed to absorb all the material that New Yorkers could separate for recycling, he said.   Opponents of incinerators are very likely to take issue with the Sanitation Department analysis that only 25 percent recycling is economically feasible.   But city officials say that just to reach the 25 percent level will require adding to the six materials many New Yorkers currently separate for recycling pickup. About 6 percent of the trash collected by the Sanitation Department is now being separated under the city's struggling two-and-a-half-year-old recycling program.   Mr. Polan is to present highlights of the administration's plan at a state legislative hearing on solid waste today at 11 A.M. at 270 Broadway in New York City. A city solid waste management plan required by state law -- already five months late -- is expected to be completed and released for public comment by Nov. 1, Mr. Polan said. In the interview yesterday, Mr. Polan offered only an outline of the plan, and it was unclear when the new incinerators would be built.    After hearings in November and December, the plan will be modified and submitted to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The city cannot build trash processing or disposal plants until the plan receives state approval.   Many officials, including Mr. Dinkins's First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, maintain that recycling has limits and that with landfill capacity running out, the city has no alternative except to burn a substantial amount of its trash. Incineration proponents say modern plants are safe if properly maintained. Dinkins' 1989 Promise    In 1989, Mr. Dinkins promised to delay a decision until 1993 about building more incinerators, pending a review of the city's trash disposal needs.   ""We're not going to have giant, mass-burn incinerators in every borough belching poison into the air,"" he said, after receiving the endorsement of the New York League of Conservation Voters.   The next February, Mr. Dinkins said at a conference on the environment: ""You all know that I have some very serious concerns about the consequences of proceeding with resource-recovery plants, especially with regard to the toxic ash produced by that technology. Unless my concerns are adequately answered, we will not proceed with incineration.""   Resource-recovery plants are incinerators that convert garbage-generated steam into electric power.   Under one Koch administration plan, new incinerators would have been built in each borough. Mr. Polan said the Dinkins plan would require building two or three new incinerators and the expansion of three existing units, which is under way. Construction of an incinerator at the old Brooklyn Navy Yard remains a possibility, a department spokeswoman, Anne Canty, said.   The Sanitation Department's study found that incineration is the cheapest way to dispose of trash, Mr. Polan said, but an approach limited to burning would be at odds with the state's environmental priorities and increasing national emphasis on more recycling.   He reiterated that the city's current recycling program is struggling and needs an overhaul badly. Such an overhaul would require big revisions in the city's mandatory recycling law, which contemplated 25 percent recycling by spring 1994.   Sounding an old theme, Mr. Polan said achieving 25 percent recycling at an affordable cost will require changes in sanitation union work rules. The department needs more flexibility to move workers from collection to recycling routes, he said. Bargaining between management and the union has gone nowhere on the issue.

1991,1990,"To the Editor: While in Banglaore, India, last year I purchased several artifacts from Natesan's Antiquarts. This was supposedly a well-known establishment with several offices in India. After they were unable to package my purchases so that I could take them with me they told me that they would charge me $150 all inclusive to have the items delivered in New York. When the items arrived, there were other fees of approximately $60 due. When I wrote to Natesan's for reimbursement, they ignored their commitment and stated that the fees were ""probably some port charges and incidental expenses."" They added that they themselves had incurred additional expenses but did not bill us for them as we were ""an esteemed customer.""    The moral is that no matter how big and well established a firm is, caveat emptor.  S. KATZ West Nyack, N.Y. Krishnagopal Natesan, director, Natesan's Antiqarts, replies: The Katzes purchased two wooden handicraft items. Under their instructions, these were dispatched by sea on a freight-prepaid basis. We collected on their credit card $150 for packing, insurance and freight. On any sea cargo, a nominal amount has to be paid at the destination port by the customer, as is mentioned in the American President Lines bill of lading. That was $23. Since they did not collect cargo on time, they had to pay storage charges of $26. The buyers misunderstood if they thought that they would not have to pay any incidental charges at their end. We have been in business for six decades and have many satisfied customers. India "

1996,1990,"An article yesterday about campaign fund-raising for the 1996 elections referred incorrectly to fund-raising efforts by John Huang, a Democratic operative who had worked in the Commerce Department. The Democratic National Committee has returned more than $1 million in contributions brought in by Mr. Huang from others, including $250,000 from a South Korean company that may have violated the law prohibiting foreign companies from donating to political parties, but Mr. Huang's precise role in those transactions has not yet been determined. There is no known evidence that he raised money from an Indonesian conglomerate for which he once worked. Mr. Huang, an American citizen, has also not been accused of making illegal foreign contributions himself.    The article also misstated the totals of the ''soft money'' raised by the political parties -- money for party activities rather than individual campaigns. In 1992, the total was $89 million and in 1994 $107 million this year it is expected to be $250 million. (The amounts are in the millions, not billions.)   Corrections"

1995,1990,"WHILE most of the world waited for news of the official investigation into the Oklahoma bombing, callers and talk show hosts on World Wide Christian Radio, the Nashville shortwave station that has become the shrill voice of the far right, had it all figured out: the Federal Building was destroyed as part of a plot by the United States Government, acting on behalf of a secret international cabal, the New World Order, whose symbol, the cold staring eye in the pyramid, mocks Americans from the back of every one dollar bill.     Within days, the bombing had been tightly woven into the sprawling conspiracy theories that have obsessed some Americans since the beginning of the Republic. The historian Richard Hofstadter coined the phrase ""the paranoid style in American politics"" to describe this pathological world view in which history is a Manichean struggle between the forces of light and of darkness.

His eyes bulged, too, capillaries zigzagging from the pupils in all directions. His face was pulled tight about the jaw, which thrust forward like a snowplow attachment on the grille of a truck. From the flattened O of his mouth, the word ""murderer"" erupted in a regular rhythm, the repetition of the r's giving the word the sound of an outboard motor that failed to catch.   She, for her part, paced up and down directly in front of him, saying nothing. Instead, she held high a large cardboard sign on a stick, showing the cartoonish drawing of a bloody coat hanger over the caption, ""Never again."" Like his, her face was taut with fury, her lips pressed together so tightly they folded under and vanished. Whenever she drew close to him, she would deliberately lower the sign and turn it toward him, so that he would be yelling his ""murderer"" at the picture of the coat hanger.

Some sell ""face cords"" made up of logs that are cut to more manageable lengths. Four-foot logs do not fit in typical fireplaces. The wood in a face cord might be one or two feet long.

1993,1990,"No matter what else you might say about ""The Wiz,"" the all-black 1974 musical based on L. Frank Baum's classic, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"" it is an ebullient family crowd-pleaser. And a new production at the Beacon Theater, directed by George Faison and starring Stephanie Mills and Andre De Shields from the original Broadway cast, demonstrates that it doesn't take much to refresh the show, which ran on Broadway for four years. All that's needed is an infusion of contemporary slang and choreography (including a little Michael Jackson moonwalking and sexy L. L. Cool J-style pushups) to bring it up to date.   ""The Wiz"" takes a story so familiar that it doesn't have to be meticulously told to be followed, and reconceives it as a modern vaudeville entertainment with a pop-gospel score. The show is much jollier in tone than the movie ""The Wizard of Oz,"" which conveyed deep currents of Depression-era anxiety and longing for better times. Stephanie Mills's Dorothy has more pluck and brass than Judy Garland's waifish prairie dreamer. And while Ms. Mills's traveling companions on the Yellow Brick Road bemoan their lack of brains, heart and courage, the show's Scarecrow, Tinman and Lion are not so poignantly bereft of self-confidence as their movie counterparts.

1993,1990,"It is unlikely that Johnny James cared, as he sat awaiting his death on Friday in Texas's execution chamber in Huntsville, that he would have a macabre distinction, one which could make him a footnote in the annals of capital punishment. The 39-year-old former truck driver, convicted of a 1985 rape and murder, made no final statement. Witnesses said he kept his eyes closed from the moment he was seated until he was pronounced dead by means of a lethal injection at 12:17 A.M.    But Mr. James's death, the seventh execution in Texas in the past six weeks and the 14th this year, was something of a statistical landmark. Texas has now executed more people in 1993 than any year since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 and more than in any year since 1938, when 18 people were sent to the electric chair. With Practice, Texas Is the Execution Leader "
1992,1990,"LAST week's economic reports were a hearty, heartening Thanksgiving feast for statistics mavens. The economy grew by a stunning 3.9 percent in the third quarter, orders for big-ticket factory goods soared in October, and consumer confidence finally lifted itself.    Although this news provides some much-needed holiday cheer, the consensus among economists is that the 3.9 percent jump in third-quarter output overstates the economy's underlying growth rate. They expect fourth-quarter growth to be weaker, between 2 and 2.75 percent, for several reasons. Consumer spending in the third quarter grew faster than disposable income, and third-quarter military spending rocketed despite the downward trend in military outlays. In addition, business inventories grew strongly for the second straight quarter and corporations won't want to continue that trend. The Economy: Holiday Cheer, But Will It Last? "

1996,1990,"When New York State's Education Commissioner, Richard Mills, recently announced that high school graduation requirements would be toughened statewide, he asked the Legislature to support the effort with more money for education in  general and for textbooks in particular. As things now stand, public schools will lose more than $150 million over all under Gov. George Pataki's current budget proposal, and the schools may not get all of it back. But by making a special plea for textbooks, Mr. Mills underscored an obvious point -- effective  education is impossible when students lack the most fundamental learning tools.          Funding for textbooks has traditionally been kept low, with the tacit understanding that communities would raise money to make up the difference. Affluent communities have done reasonably well. But poor systems like New York City's have fallen further and further behind. The city has significantly fewer  books per student than districts elsewhere in the state. In a recent poll by a civic organization called the Educational Priorities Panel, one-third of city teachers said they lacked enough textbooks to cover their classes or let students take textbooks home.

1992,1990,"The rise of video and performance art over the last two decades has been nurtured by the Kitchen, which on Wednesday night gave a benefit concert that consisted of examples of these expressive forms. The Kitchen, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary, has been one of the centers for what was once called the avant-garde. Of course, the notion of the avant-garde is somewhat passe since esthetic and political opposition have become commonplace sentiments. But the polemical spirit remains, and in video and performance art it regains some attraction and novelty through the use of electronic media. Television and video, commercial advertising techniques and electronic processing of sound become the objects of attention as well as the methods for expression, the message as well as the medium.   Thus, in a rather sardonic video piece, ""Made for TV,"" Tom Rubnitz created a television video about television. Punctuated by the static of purported channel hopping, it is a 15-minute portrait of pop American culture. As the screen flickers from channel to channel, the actress Ann Magnuson appears as a teary television missionary appealing for money, as a newscaster with an almost plastic face, as a mad grotesque romping through a cemetery in a rock video and as a sincere drinker of great coffee. Satire of television has become one of the staples of television humor here the familiarly funny merged with a traditional avant-garde scorn for a culture that could have spawned such imagery.

1994,1990,"""WHEN I BEGAN WORKing for First Bank in Minneapolis in 1980, they had about a thousand duck prints,"" said Lynne Sowder, who advises corporations about their art collections. ""We called it Art Ducko."" 

She eventually assembled for First Bank one of the most radical corporate collections of contemporary art in the country, including sexually explicit work by artists like Andres Serrano, Cindy Sherman and Barbara Kruger. But the employees quickly rebelled. ""The bank was very white Scandinavian, with no outward expression of rage,"" said Ms. Sowder. ""They would put plants in front of the art or make the pieces crooked -- very passive-aggressive.""

In the 1980's, collecting art was the thing to do if a company wanted to seem culturally minded and on the cutting edge. The requirements, usually, were three: the availability of serious money, somebody in a position of power who was interested in pushing for an art collection, and an outside consultant. 

But after a few years things changed dramatically. When the economy started to falter in the late 1980's, corporations had trouble explaining to stockholders why they were spending money on art when stock prices were plunging. Fashions changed too. Conspicuous consumption became as impolitic for corporations as for individuals. 

The new mood affected corporations in different ways. Some simply abandoned their artistic aspirations others were clever enough to reconfigure their programs, and chose to weather the criticism that increasingly accompanied corporate collecting.

No statistics track corporate collecting of fine art, but the Business Committee for the Arts, a nonprofit organization that encourages businesses to invest in the arts, surveys companies every three years about their overall spending on cultural activities. It found that businesses spent $698 million on the arts in general in 1985; by 1991, the last year the survey was conducted, the figure had shrunk to $518 million. 

For some corporations, collecting art had become a liability, and they responded accordingly. At First Bank, for example, it was decided that the offended workers should have a say. ""In 1987 we started a program called Talk Back,"" said Ms. Sowder. ""The forms came back filled with rage. We turned around and published the employees' responses in a monthly newsletter and created a dialogue within the bank."" The next year First Bank set aside an area called Controversy Corridor to which any six employees could banish a work of art they deemed unacceptable.

""We got this kind of X-rated gallery,"" said Ms. Sowder. But when employees started using the Talk Back forms to complain about the bank as a whole, she said, the collection was viewed as causing too much turmoil. The buying program came to an end.

Another company whose years as a corporate Medici ended in a fire sale was Pacific Enterprises, a Los Angeles utility that began divesting after making a number of acquisitions in the 80's. With the help of Susan Rush, a corporate art consultant, Pacific Enterprises bought the works of many young artists and commissioned many more. Its corporate headquarters features a Richard Artschwager reception desk, a boxlike sculpture that accommodates three people, and an eight-story glass-encased staircase by David Ireland, a San Francisco architect and sculptor. 

The company spent about $2 million in a couple of years, Ms. Rush said, on approximately 450 pieces of art for its 12-floor building. Ms. Rush even supervised the making of a 22-minute film about the collection for the employees.

Then in 1991 it all caved in. ""They had a lot of lawsuits,"" Ms. Rush said. ""Shareholders were questioning the fact that the company bought art when the stock dropped so precipitously."" Twenty percent of the collection was sold, including 52 pieces in one sale at Sotheby's in February. Ms. Rush says the company was lucky enough to break even.

The responses by companies to fading stockholder support for art are as varied as the personalities of their chairmen. In general, large corporations collected more conservatively, so they had less far to fall than First Bank or Pacific Enterprises. But there were some uncomfortable transitions.

The experience of the Equitable Life Assurance Company was emblematic of the corporate relationship to art during the prosperous 80's. Led by Benjamin D. Holloway, chairman of its real estate group, the company commissioned the 68-by-32-foot ""Mural With Blue Brushstroke,"" by Roy Lichtenstein, for its impressive new headquarters on Seventh Avenue at 51st Street in Manhattan, along with a cycle of Sandro Chia paintings for the Palio restaurant in the building, a huge wall painting by Sol LeWitt and an outdoor seating area by the sculptor Scott Burton. The company had the extra cachet of having a branch of the Whitney Museum in its building. 

That association ended two years ago, when Equitable asked the Whitney to leave, because, according to Pari Stave, director of the Equitable art program, ""it made sense to support more than one institution."" Equitable's activities are now limited to an art gallery on the former Whitney premises and the purchase of minor art for corporate dining rooms.

UNTIL JULY, I.B.M. HAD A LIVEly gallery on the lower level of its skyscraper at Madison Avenue and 56th Street in Manhattan. But the company fell on hard times and sold the building earlier this year, and the museum-quality shows it brought to New York are no more. Richard P. Berglund, who was the director of cultural programs, is now working as a consultant to the company, taking inventory and dispersing I.B.M.'s extensive collection. 

But once again there is change in the air. As the economy improves, collecting is re-emerging here and there as good public relations. Paine Webber, the Wall Street brokerage firm, bought top-flight examples of works by contemporary artists in the 1980's, when the market was at its height. The corridor leading to the office of its chairman, Donald Marron, has the feel of a shrine to the esthetics of that era. The Eric Fischl, the David Salle, the Jean-Michel Basquiat -- all are among the best or near best works of the artists.

Although the company severely altered its approach, it did not allow its program to die. Today it is mostly buying works of artists at an earlier stage in their careers and at far lower prices. Mr. Marron, a collector himself and a vice chairman of the Museum of Modern Art, is the powerhouse behind this collection.

""There's usually one person, one eye in a corporate art collection,"" he said. ""Our goal is to find quality, to expose employees and clients to it."" Under the auspices of Jennifer Wells, director of its art program, the company has bought works by young artists like Kiki Smith, Damien Hirst and Guillermo Kuitca.

And the Chase Manhattan Bank, with its impeccable art connections, has also stayed the course, even though it has not been immune to economic pressures. Long headed by David Rockefeller, who is now chairman emeritus and former chairman of the Museum of Modern Art, the bank had been collecting art for decades. Its downtown headquarters houses pieces like ""Four Trees,"" a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet, and Isamu Noguchi's ""Pool.""

In the early 1990's, the bank was having second thoughts about having paid a total of approximately $1.5 million for works by Dan Flavin, Nam June Paik, Bruce Nauman and R. M. Fischer for Metrotech Center, its new office complex in downtown Brooklyn. Metrotech was planned in the 80's and under construction when the bank started to lose money on many of its commercial real estate holdings.

Manuel E. Gonzalez, executive director of the bank's art program, stoutly defended the purchases: the art was of high quality and perfect for its environment -- Chase's high-tech back office operations are at Metrotech, and the pieces by Mr. Flavin and Mr. Paik are particularly concerned with the effects of technology. The bank received generally good publicity in the press, and both Mr. Rockefeller and Thomas Labrecque, the present chief executive officer, supported Mr. Gonzalez.

A Chase traveling exhibition called ""Photoplay,"" organized by Mr. Gonzalez and Lisa Phillips, a longtime Whitney curator, showcases the bank's vast contemporary photography holdings. The bank is also embarking on an ambitious venture in Japan -- a Chase-owned museum, designed by Michael McCarthy, the designer of Metrotech, to open early next year. ""We will have two exhibitions a year there -- one generated from the Chase collection and one generated locally,"" said Mr. Gonzalez. ""And we are also resuming our program of purchases.""

After the retrenchment by big corporations, one new collection seems particularly intrepid. Begun in 1991, it is on four floors at the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. It focuses entirely on works on paper (costing an average of $1,500 each) by young artists, some of whom have yet to have their first gallery shows. A printed walking tour pictures the work and provides descriptions. The collecting was overseen by Carl Lobell, a partner in the firm, and Carolyn Alexander, co-owner and vice president of the Brooke Alexander Gallery.

Since leaving First Bank, Lynne Sowder has continued trying to inject art into the corporate landscape, now as the head of Ycore (pronounced Y-core), a Chicago consulting firm. Her projects include a publicity campaign, with Liz Claiborne, that uses artists to create works that protest domestic violence. 

Did she have any final thoughts about First Bank? Had its corporate culture changed? ""I understand,"" she said, ""that they're now buying lots of duck art."" How Corporate Collecting Fell on Hard Times"

1991,1990,"John W. Meriwether, a fiercely competitive Salomon Brothers vice chairman, is the only one of the three top executives who knew about Salomon's transgressions in the Treasury market last April who has not offered his resignation to the board. It was too soon to tell yesterday whether, by not offering his resignation, he would be permitted to remain at the firm, or what the extent of his knowledge of the firm's transgressions really was.    Mr. Meriwether is known within the firm as an ambitious executive who lives and breathes bond trading. His reputation as a bluff-caller was enhanced by the book ""Liar's Poker"" by Michael Lewis. The book opens with a scene where Mr. Gutfreund approaches him with an offer to play a form of poker based on guessing the serial numbers on a dollar bill. Mr. Gutfreund was challenging Mr. Meriwether to a game for $1 million. As the story goes, Mr. Meriwether countered with a $10 million bet. Fate of One Top Officer Still Appears Uncertain "

This is the utopia our simple ancestors dreamed of. In the days when people did not have enough to eat, they believed that the secret of happiness was eating far too much, which, of course, it is. This is why we are all so deliriously happy.

1992,1990,"A FRIEND writes:   Sometimes what turns out to be a surprisingly pleasant day simply sneaks up on a New Yorker, perhaps leaving the trace of a satisfied smile or wonder of wonders, a warm feeling about the city itself. Last Thursday, for instance.   It had not been my all-time greatest day at work. By five o'clock I was Mr. Gloom. Then a friend phoned to say he had an extra ticket for that night's opening of ""Marvin's Room"" in the Village followed by a party at La Boheme next door. What had I to lose? I was depressed anyway.   The play was fine and I even found myself laughing. The party was a crush of familiar and not-quite-so-recognizable faces. I saw Al Hirschfeld eating pizza without soiling his snowy beard. I spotted Madeleine Kahn, looking terrific, coming away from the buffet table somehow juggling two full dinner plates and a large beverage. ""May I have your autograph?"" I asked. Her laughter made me feel really great. When Eileen Heckart brushed by, my friend stopped her and said, ""Would you like to meet a man who thinks you're wonderful?"" She said yes, smiled and shook my hand.   My friend and I walked around the Village and wound up at cafe on Charles Street. It was warm enough to sit outside. We had double espressos and talked about Italy. The waitress joined our conversation: it turned out that her relatives in Milan are good friends with people I know who live in a nearby town.   ""I used to see you passing by with your dog,"" the waitress said.   ""I had to put him to sleep,"" I told her.   She looked sad. ""From now on I will wave to you,"" she promised. The world seemed small, gentle and friendly again.   In my apartment building elevator, another tenant, a man from India, got on. ""I miss your dog very much,"" he said as he got off on his floor.   Nothing significant happened last Thursday. I went to a play, on to a party, spoke to two actresses I admire, had espresso outdoors, made friends with a waitress and was comforted by a neighbor. All in all it was a good day to be a New Yorker.                      . . .         A fellow we know was on a bus heading home after working late when he heard two men -- early 30's -- in deep conversation concerning adjustable mortgage rates, property taxes and such.     Man one:    My wife and I just moved to Bloomfield. We got a nice place there, beautiful old house.     Man two:    What style?     Man one:    Cape Cod. Built in 1956.     Man two:    Wow! They don't make houses like that anymore.                      . . .       GOING PLACES   Waiting curbside for the bus, I glimpse a length  of trolley track once paved over but  now laid bare by traffic's fierce erosion.  And for a flash in time  the token in my hand  becomes a nickel  as I stand among fedoras  and hear the clank and squeal  of metal wheels that bring to me  this little folding step  that pops down like a genie's palm  and says hop up kid we're going places.  But here's my bus. Now look at that.  The sign across its front says  Limited.  I couldn't have said it better. -- MARCEL J. SISLOWITZ                      . . .         Zabar's on a recent Saturday afternoon.   I pick out a wedge of ripe Brie to have the next day at a brunch for the naming of my new granddaughter. A voice: ""Why would you take that one when there are others right next to it that are a dollar a pound cheaper?""   ""I didn't notice,"" I admit sheepishly. I pick out a less expensive piece.   ""I couldn't believe it,"" the voice persists, ""when I saw you pick up the first one.""   I move over to the counter to get some chevre. The loudspeaker announces an instant special: whole wheels of Brie for $3.99, reduced from $12.99. The voice is back: ""Did you hear that?""   ""I heard it, but I don't know where they are.""   ""I'll find it,"" she says. She is back almost instantly. ""Come with me.""   Obediently, I follow to a table near the checkout. None of the wheels are ripe enough. I explain that I have to have one that can be eaten tomorrow.  ""Here,"" she says, ""take mine,"" offering me a ripe wheel priced about the same as my much smaller wedge. ""I don't need one for tomorrow."" Delighted, I accept.   ""Where are you from?"" she asks. ""Seattle,"" I answer.   ""I could tell you were from out of town.""    ""But I lived here for years,"" I protest.    ""Well,"" she says, ""you've lost your edge."" -- EVELYN KLEBANOFF Metropolitan Diary "

1994,1990,"For four decades, until last year, the Socialist Party regarded itself as the conscience of Japan. After a brief flirtation with power in 1948, it settled into place as the permanent opposition party and seemed to take pride in the fact that it stood by its principles -- ardent pacifism, workers' rights, anti-Americanism -- rather than fighting for power.   As years passed, the Socialists exerted almost no influence over the conservative, increasingly corrupt power structure, and it has suffered its own corruption scandals. But the party remained the second-largest in Parliament, and its position struck a resonant chord with many Japanese. Most people regarded the Socialists as unsuited to govern but a useful check against the Liberal Democrats.  A Setback for Anti-Americanism    Never was this moral stance more in evidence than in 1960, when rioting broke out among Japanese who opposed extending the postwar security treaty with the United States. Many people, particularly university students and women, regarded the treaty as a humiliating vestige of World War II that drew Japan into the cold war and made Japan a vassal.

But he is not a pop star, however much he may look and act like one. He is a 35-year-old English violinist named Nigel Kennedy, and on his home turf he enjoys a name recognition that few classical musicians have achieved. In the United States, so far, such notoriety has eluded him.

1991,1990,"Every day about 30 million letters go astray. The Postal Service says the causes include incorrect addressing, and handwriting so illegible that neither human nor machine can decipher it. Here are some ways to avoid problems, especially with the approach of the holiday mailing period, when more mail than ever is likely to go astray. Clarity Use a typewriter, a computer printer or handwritten block letters.  Limit the address to four or five lines.  ZIP Code To be read by the Postal Service's high-speed optical character machines the ZIP code should be on the last line of the address, after the state. An incorrect ZIP code, or the omission of one, will cause a delay.  Apartment Numbers The apartment number should immediately follow the street address on the same line. Absence of numbers is a big reason for nondelivery.  'Courtesy' Envelopes Don't try to reroute a reply envelope that has a bar code at the bottom by placing a new address label over the printed address. The postal machine will read the bar code and send the mail to the destination the code represents.

1992,1990,"A collection of articles and illustrations published in scientific journals between 1865 and 1900, VICTORIAN INVENTIONS (John Murray/Trafalgar Square, Paper, $24.95) intends to foster admiration for those intrepid Victorian inventors who laid the groundwork for many of the devices that define modern life -- electrical appliances, the telephone, the airplane, X-ray machines. But inevitably such high-mindedness is subverted by the inclusion of so many inventions that are remarkable only for their outlandish mechanical absurdity, execrable esthetics or bad taste. One rare gem is a machine for electroplating the dead. The dream world of the Victorian inventor was filled with the overhead clattering of pedal-propelled helicopters, miniature electric trains fetching fish and sauce from the kitchen, and prim passengers in bullet-shaped carriages free-falling from the Eiffel Tower into a pond. The illustrations -- replete with stiff men wearing top hats and handlebar mustaches, and women in bustle skirts -- are largely responsible for the comic effect. Aside from a brief and straight-faced introduction, Leonard de Vries, the author of ""Victorian Advertisements,"" provides no editorial comment. The book makes clear that whatever we inherited from the Victorians that was eminently useful, they were also responsible for the love of gadgets for the sake of gadgetry.

1991,1990,"To the Editor:   William C. Crawford's contention (""Advice Every Investor Should Ignore,"" Feb. 10) that ""every investor in the stock and bond markets is taking into account the same bad news,"" is true enough regarding national and world events. But your readers should not construe this to mean that all the information about any given stock is built into the stock's price. This may be true about the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, but it is not likely true about second-tier stocks and certainly not true about most small company stocks.   A small company may tell its story in a number of cities and yet not be written about in the national press, evaluated in print by an analyst, or placed on the buy list of a national borkerage firm. And then one day one of those events occurs, and the stock's price begins rising. Nothing has changed except suddenly the company has a following. The buyers bidding up the price of the stock are doing so on the same information that was available on a more limited basis. ROBERT A.

A latecomer to the circle of Abstract Expressionists that included Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, Guston (1913-80) was never completely at ease with the modernists' rejection of what he called ""the known image."" By the late 1960's, when abstraction was still enjoying its heyday, Guston was filling his canvases with everyday objects -- books, light bulbs, shoes, bottles, clocks. It was a heresy for which the artist paid dearly. Unnerved by the New York art critics who derided the new works as crude and cartoonlike, Guston retreated to upstate Woodstock, where he turned to a group of poets and writers for artistic solace. These alliances led to a series of collaborations in the 70's with the poets Bill Berkson, Clark Coolidge, William Corbett and Stanley Kunitz. PHILIP GUSTON'S POEM-PICTURES (University of Washington, paper, $19.95), with text by Debra Bricker Balken, the curator of an exhibition of these works, illustrates this critical turning point in Guston's career. The works Guston created with his poet colleagues were not traditional collaborations rather they were conflations of parallel, independent sensibilities in which he tested the relationship between pictures as images and words as images. As William Corbett writes, these works were not illustrations; they show Guston ""expressing his reader's imagination."" ANDREA BARNET Parallel Sensibilities"

1993,1990,"As summer turns to fall and the art world revs up for the new season, one of the slower, more meditative esthetic experiences available in New York City is ""Singular Dimensions in Painting"" at the Guggenheim Museum SoHo. This show places before the viewer nearly 40 Minimalist or proto-Minimalist paintings from the 1950's, 60's and 70's, most of them from the museum's collection. Dominated by canvases in muted shades of gray, olive, blue and white or intractable black, it is nothing if not quiet and serene.   Although somewhat flawed in conception and limited in breadth, ""Singular Dimensions"" offers one of the most extensive surveys of this style in several years. By concentrating on painting instead of sculpture, it emphasizes Minimalism's gentler side, countering the tendency among feminist art historians to see it rather simplistically as a uniformly authoritarian, macho way of art making.

1991,1990,"THE gulf war made one thing clear: Even with Iraq and Kuwait not producing, the Middle East can flood the world with enough oil to push crude oil prices down to $15 a barrel and perhaps lower. The United States, in sum, might find itself back in the old days of cheap oil. Is that good news for the American economy? Or would $10-a-barrel oil, once such a blessing, be a curse today?    The answers vary. Homeowners who use oil heat would applaud so would car owners who drive a lot. The airline industry might use the savings from lower fuel bills to invest in more planes and, similarly, a United Parcel Service might buy more delivery trucks and hire more drivers.

1991,1990,"It's easy to understand why Mayor David Dinkins might feel picked on. Under previous Mayors the New York City Council was a rubber stamp, rarely known to ask embarrassing questions much less demand answers. But now that the city is operating under its new charter, the rules have changed dramatically. The Council this week asserted a more active oversight role and the Mayor has wisely, if grudgingly, begun to accommodate.   On Monday the Council was supposed to hear testimony on why the city had decided to let subways back on the deteriorating Manhattan Bridge despite warnings from engineers that it was unsafe.  But the committee canceled the hearing. City Hall refused to provide documents -- including correspondence between Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and Transportation Commissioner Lucius Riccio -- that could shed light on the condition of the bridge and the administration's approach to bridge safety.     The Council's Public Safety Committee was also angered when the Fire Commissioner, Carlos Rivera, refused to hand over a list of the 41 firehouses he once suggested would have to be closed to help reduce the city's budget gap. The City Council Speaker, Peter Vallone, promptly threatened to subpoena all the bridge and firehouse documents if they were not produced by tomorrow.    City Hall at first said it would go to court to block release of information considered privileged between the Mayor and city officials. But Mr. Dinkins sensibly decided to release the documents yesterday, to avert a major constitutional clash.   The future may well see more conflicts. The bridge documents handed over contain huge blanks where City Hall deleted material it says is not germane, perpetuating the impression there is something to hide. But having so far bested the Mayor toe-to-toe, the Council has a special duty to use its new powers constructively, and not, as City Hall feared, for political mischief.

(Wall Street, June 9) creates an erroneous impression regarding Judicate Inc. by suggesting that proper disclosure procedures were not followed. The pilot program with the National Association of Securities Dealers represents just one of a number of new company programs which began in 1991. This program has meaningful potential and provides the brokerage community with a much-needed service. However, Judicate does not feel that every contract signed in its normal course of business triggers a disclosure obligation. The N.A.S.D. press release represented an element in a public relations campaign to provide the requisite exposure to potential participants within the brokerage industry. This is no different than one of our major insurance carrier customers endorsing the use of Judicate to their various branch offices.

1991,1990,"To the Editor:   I read with interest your Feb. 2 report on Bishop John S. Spong's recent book suggesting that St. Paul was a repressed homosexual as reflected in ""Paul's self-judging rhetoric, his negative feeling toward his own body and his sense of being controlled by something he had no power to change.""   I am astonished that Bishop Spong did not properly research his subject. Had he done so, he would have discovered that there is a body of medical literature on the subject of Paul's infirmity. Speculation has favored the assumption that Paul had temporal lobe epilepsy.   This condition has certain clinical symptoms, including (1) hyperreligiosity (2) hypergraphia, which is the tendency to spend a great deal of time writing; (3) hyposexuality, diminished sexual drive, which could account for his not being married, and (4) epileptic seizures, which may produce a brief but intense alteration experienced as hallucinatory activity, so that some physicians have made the suggestion that Paul's vision on the road to Damascus was in fact an epileptic fit.   Today the condition can be controlled by medication, but in Paul's time this ""sacred disease"" could not be treated, and one could appreciate ""his sense of being controlled by something he had no power to change."" Bishop Spong has the right to publish his speculations that Paul was a secret homosexual, but overlooking significant medical literature speaks poorly for his scholarship.   WALLACE K.

1998,1990,"Steven F. Goldstone, the chairman and chief executive officer of one of the four most reviled corporations in America, looks like a man in need of a cigarette. A dismal funk has settled over the Benton Convention Center in Winston-Salem, N.C., which is where his company, RJR Nabisco, is about to open its annual shareholders' meeting. The meeting won't be pleasant for him, but what is these days? It's reefer madness out there -- not so much in Winston-Salem, one of the last of the country's pro-tobacco redoubts, but almost everywhere else.    It is perhaps the worst moment in history to be a tobacco C.E.O. The industry Goldstone leads is a pariah, the Libya of American commerce. Congress has spun itself into a frenzy, weighing huge tax increases on tobacco and considering measures to let the Food and Drug Administration regulate the nicotine out of cigarettes. Wall Street, meanwhile, views the tobacco companies the way Sloan-Kettering views smoking. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation is a highly leveraged company, and its stock price is so depressed that the company's market cap -- the total value of all outstanding shares -- is actually exceeded by its debt.    Goldstone, a shortish and combative 52-year-old, is Big Tobacco's prime strategist. Last year he led his fellow C.E.O.'s into historic negotiations with their enemies, the state attorneys general who had made it their mission to take down Big Tobacco. Two and a half years ago, before he became president of RJR Nabisco, which owns R.J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest tobacco company, he was just another rich Wall Street lawyer. But now that Goldstone oversees the production of Camels, Winstons and Dorals, it seems an article of faith among tobacco's foes that he pushes drugs to children. When I asked C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, if he thought Goldstone was actually evil, he answered, ''Is it evil to know that the product you sell is going to kill one-third of your customers, and then sell it anyway?''

2005,2000,"AFTER ''Pat and Mike'' and their 1940's hits, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy made one last comedy, Walter Lang's smart, grown-up DESK SET (1957). Hepburn plays Bunny Watson, the erudite head of the reference department at the Federal Broadcasting Company, and Tracy is the consultant hired to bring in their first computer. Even when a rainstorm-related taxi shortage throws them together, for fried chicken at her apartment, she's sure he plans to replace her and her employees with a machine. The script, by Phoebe and Henry Ephron (Nora, Delia and Amy's parents), proves that talent runs in the family. ''There are 85 calories in a glass of champagne,'' one employee (Joan Blondell) observes at the office Christmas party. Bunny tells her, ''Oh, I have a little place in my neighborhood where I can get it for 65'' -- Saturday at 11:10 p.m. on Channel 13.    Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon and Gene Hackman are the stars of Robert Benton's ultra-stylish drama TWILIGHT (1998), but this is one of those films with well-known actors in the supporting roles too. They include James Garner, Stockard Channing, Liev Schreiber, Giancarlo Esposito and, as the wayward daughter, 22-year-old Reese Witherspoon, unknown at the time. Mr. Newman plays a former private eye who lives as a permanent houseguest of a rich, terminally ill friend (Mr. Hackman) and his faded-movie-star wife (Susan Sarandon). There's a proper mystery plot about blackmail, an abandoned ranch and a long-ago suicide, but the film's appeal is largely a function of star power -- Thursday at 10:15 a.m. and 8 p.m. on TMC.

Or would it make sense to plant them in a big pot to get them started and then put the pot inside a very cool place for the winter?    A.  Run, do not walk, to the nearest empty spot in your garden and plant the dahlias. A dahlia tuber (it's not a bulb) isn't like a seed, with the ability to wait in a dormant state, even for years, until the environment is right for germination. They may not look like it, but under normal conditions -- including those where you misplaced them -- tubers constantly change. Their physiological processes respond to temperature changes, and they do what they are programmed to do.    GARDEN Q.& A. "

Lower prices are supposed to allow poor households to save more money to better their lives.

2008,2000,"1. Not many stores can claim to have inspired a book by Émile Zola. Or boast a 344,000-square-foot glass-and-steel structure engineered by Gustave Eiffel. But then the venerable Paris emporium Le Bon Marché isn’t your average department store. According to Christine Chapellu, who, along with Régine Beraud, heads up the women’s fashion buying team: “Our clients don’t even like department stores. They not only come to shop, but they come to wander around, take in art exhibitions and literary workshops and generally discover beautiful things.”. Gallic Symbol "
2006,2000,"Politicians sometimes give sartorial signals about their intentions. This week, David Cameron, the new leader of Britain's opposition Conservatives, tried to make his statement with a celebrity-studded Black and White Ball, a supposedly hip event awash with velvet suits, open-neck shirts and décolleté dresses to replace the Tories' traditional, tuxedoed Winter Ball.     But the attire that attached itself more durably to Mr. Cameron's image this week was the humble rubber sandal of the beaches: the flip-flop, referring to the way he has reversed longstanding policies of his party since he took over the leadership in December. He has redrawn traditional Tory policies on tax, education and health, some of which he drafted only last year.   Tory Chief's Move to Center Is Assailed as Flip-Flopping "

2009,2000,"<div class=""w120 left""> <img src=""http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/themoment/posts/0211scentnotes.jpg"" alt=""w120 Image""> </div>The quality of superniche scent collections varies hugely. Filmmakers who shoot at their parents' homes and produce on credit-card-financed shoestrings create, for the most part, erratic movies, and independent perfumers generally produce erratic collections. There are the political perfumes (""all natural! all organic!""), which tend to smell like bottled ideologies, and theme collections (""Japan!""), and the slightly trite ""I hunt the planet for the most fabulous materials."" And if the scents are almost always inferior to the Diors and the Tom Fords, it is due to the fact that perfume is not do-it-yourself. <!--more-->It is an excruciatingly difficult art form that requires trained professionals with access to the materials and technicians. And even then they can bomb. Most niche scent makers do forgettable work. One exception is Dawn Spencer Hurwitz. An independent perfumer in Boulder, Colo., with a house called Parfums des Beaux Arts (why do American perfumers Scotch-tape on French names?), she has produced a collection with a very specific aesthetic. By design or not, she makes scents in the 21st-century manner that was largely pioneered by the perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena's ""big minimalism"": the crafting of intelligent fragrances that melt subtly into skin rather than sitting egotistically on top of it in the grand French manner, that glow quietly instead of shouting about the Champs-Élysées. The first Spencer Hurwitz perfume I smelled several years ago was Pamplemousse (perhaps we could call this Grapefruit and be done with it), and it was excellent. Crisp, luscious, edible, tangy grapefruit, becoming slightly darker as it evolves into a bergamot/bitter-orange aspect, like a shard of glass under halogen with someone very gradually dimming the lights.

2005,2000,"To the Editor:     In his review of Benjamin Kunkel's novel, ''Indecision'' (Aug. 28), Jay McInerney praises Kunkel for being a ''voice in the wilderness,'' leading us ''toward a hazy new frontier of hip sincerity.'' McInerney's impulse to talk about the wilderness and the frontier is very American. It allows him to imagine a cutting edge where white authors are always the pioneers, expanding what McInerney claims is the ''narrowness of our contemporary literary idiom.'' Yet, checking my bookshelf, I see many authors whose worlds are far from narrow. What about Chris Abani, Daniel Alarcón, Paul Beatty, Rattawut Lapcharoensap, Meera Nair, Akhil Sharma, Le Thi Diem Thuy, Monique Truong? These younger authors don't write about the descendants of Holden Caulfield. Instead, they bring us urgent news from all over the world, and from parts of America we've forgotten. They are evidence that we have no shortage of serious, sincere and stylish voices. We just have to listen.    Viet Thanh Nguyen     Los Angeles   The New Frontier "

The quintessential physician-scientist, Dr. Horowitz, Professor of Pediatrics and Cell Biology and Professor and Chairman of Microbiology and Immunology, was an outstanding clinician, researcher, and teacher, as well as one of the world's leading experts on adenovirus. Marshall stood out for his gentlemanly character, modesty, integrity, warmth, and wisdom he had the unique ability to bring out the best in every person he trained and with whom he worked. After winning international renown for discovering how genes encoded by adenovirus caused disease, Marshall, in characteristic fashion, converted those disease-causing genes into therapeutic tools to cure diabetes mellitus. Marshall was tirelessly and enthusiastically devoted to mentoring and nurturing the careers of generations of students, pediatric residents, fellows, scientists and faculty members. Marshall will be keenly missed, but his impact as an exemplary role model and his countless contributions to our Department, our Medical School, and the world of Medicine, will endure for generations to come.

Fenton painted in NYC in the late 50's as the explosion of Abstract Expressionism turned into a rebellion against gestural, emotional painting. More concerned about his art than his posture, expanded upon a tradition in painting with influences as diverse as Whistler and Turner as well as Ad Reinhardt and Joseph Albers. Alan Fenton was born in Cleveland in 1927, studied at the Cleveland School of Art, The Arts Students League, The New School, and at NYU, earning his BFA at Pratt Institute, where he later taught painting for many years. At seventeen, Fenton served in the Merchant Marines where he began a career as a professional boxer, a skill he had honed on the streets. He moved successfully through the graphic design business en route to becoming a painter in NY at the height of the art revolution of the fifties and sixties. He moved to NY in 1955 with his wife, Naomi Feigenbaum. She died in 1995. Fenton enjoyed success with his subtle washes and pencil drawings as well as large abstract canvases in acrylic, landing one-man shows at the prestigious Pace Gallery in NY, The NY Cultural Center Museum, The Barbara Fielder Gallery in Washington, et al. In his introduction to Fenton's exhibition catalogue for his one-man show at the Phillips Collection in Washington, Vincent Melzac wrote, ''Fenton is his own man, producing work that is uniquely his...in his work one feels that Fenton is testing the accepted and pushing for a newer and richer visual experience.'' Fenton's work resides at The Hirschhorn Museum of Art, The Corcoran Gallery, The Cleveland Museum of Art, The Smithsonian, and countless others as well as in private collections. In the late 60's he turned his artistic vision and NY business savvy towards developing creative environments where ''good and beautiful people'' could live and work together. His first endeavor was to turn the Tiffany Glass Building on lower Park Avenue into an artistic community where notable photographers, painters, and filmmakers moved in, setting the stage for a modern, hip, yet warm and friendly working space for the community which he had nurtured. He later developed the first live/work loft in Cleveland, where Fenton resided during his last years. Fenton is survived by his daughter Danielle, son-in-law Bill Garrity, their two children Adam and Gabriel, and his son David, all of NYC. He leaves behind a brother, Calvin Freedman of Tarzanna, California, and a sister, Marilyn Gelman of Boca Raton, Florida. Fenton had said about his own work, ''All that happens in my work is natural and human, hard and soft, large and small, heaven and earth. All this with the image of man, (my glow) forms a system to attain the sublime. All of these paradoxes form a triad that is the way of everything. The line is the 'hard', the formless form and the imageless image is the 'soft'. They are inseparable, one cannot exist without the other.'' Paid Notice: Deaths  FENTON, ALAN D. "

2006,2000,"By their choices for Valentine's Day activities ye shall know them. Maybe even more than New Year's Eve or Halloween, this Tuesday is not an easy day to make plans. Millions of people in New York will be under pressure to make the night special, or -- if they don't want to give the wrong impression -- not to make it too special.    Anyone looking to play it safe can head to the Apollo Theater, which is to play host to the long-running -- and hard-working -- R & B group THE O'JAYS, who won't need to make many alterations to their usual set list. Expect to hear all the hits, and be sure to scan the audience to see which couples avoid contact during ''Back Stabbers.'' 253 West 125th Street, Harlem $45 to $70; ($70 tickets include a glass of Champagne); (212) 531-5305.    Brave souls looking for something sublime can catch one of two sets from the fierce, unearthly singer DIAMANDA GALAS at the Knitting Factory; even braver souls looking for something ridiculous can head to the Nokia Theater for TOM JONES. (Tuesday is sold out; he also plays there Wednesday.) But for the truly fearless, there's no better way to celebrate Valentine's Day than a sure-to-be-chaotic concert by the reunited WU-TANG CLAN at Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, garment district, (212) 777-1224, $44. Maybe, out of respect for the day, they'll do a version of ''Ice Cream,'' the track on which Ghostface Killah is moved to declare, ''Baby's wicked like Nimrod/ Caught me like a freshwater scrod.'' Who could resist a line like that? But if you really want to play it safe this Tuesday, you need to be at the Newark Symphony Hall, which might just be -- for one night, anyway -- the most romantic room in the greater New York area. That's where the sleepy-voiced R & B crooner JAHEIM is scheduled to perform in support of his new album, ''Ghetto Classics'' (Divine Mill/Warner Brothers), which is to be released on the same day. Expect him to know what's expected of him, and to do it. 1020 Broad Street, (973) 643-8468; $55 to $75.   THE WEEK AHEAD: Feb. 12-Feb.18; POP/JAZZ"

2004,2000,"SILVER--Edward. Leading labor attorney and former Chairman of Proskauer Rose, whose commitment to the firm helped to fuel its growth and worldwide reputation, died on October 1, at his home in Greenwich, CT. The cause was cancer. Born in New York City's Hell's Kitchen, Edward graduated with distinction from Cornell Unversity Law School, where he was Managing Editor of the Law Review, having previously served as an aerial navigator in World War II, earning recognition for his courage in combat over the Pacific. He joined Proskauer in 1948 and immediately distinguished himself in the field of labor relations, earning the respect of both management and labor. He served as a member of the Labor Committee of the New York City and State Bar Associations and on the New York City Board of Collective Bargaining for 23 years. Edward was appointed special labor counsel to the City of New York by former mayors Lindsey, Beame, Koch and Dinkins. He was also a former Director and member of the Executive Committee of the American Arbitration Association and served as an arbitrator until the time of his death. Edward was a consummate New Yorker, tall and gracious, whose intellect, kindness, sense of humor, and passion for fairness will be missed by all who kenw him. He is survived by his loving wife Marlys, and his adoring children from his former marriage to Melba Silver, Ann, Erik, Owen, and Adam, daughterin-law Carlotta Mast Silver, and grandson Eli Edward Silver. A memorial service will be held at 10:30 am, on Thursday, October 7, 2004, at the American Museum of Natural History, entrance on Columbus Ave at 79th St. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to charities dedicated to securing equal rights and educational opportunities for those less advantaged.     SILVER--Edward. The officers and staff of 1199SEIU New York's Health & Human Service Union, mourn the death of this trusted and beloved friend of our Union and our industry. As counsel for the League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes, Ed Silver was a powerful advocate for humane patient care and fainancial stability in our region's great medical institutions. But he was also deeply sensitive to the needs of health care workers. In the dozen years during which Ed and League President Bruce McIver led the League of Voluntary Hospitals in contract negotiations with our Union, Ed was a constant voice for labor peace and shared progress. Those dozen years, which came after a period of turmoil and labor strife, have been the longest period of peace and stability in our industry's history. Working together, we created innovative labor/management, child care, job security and patient care programs that are unmatched in this nation. We preserved unparalleled health care benefits. And we avoided strikes. A tall, courteous gentleman, Ed had a bearing, wisdom and experience that enabled him to calm excitable colleagues on both sides. He brought out the best in us. We trusted him totally. His passing is an immense loss. But his legacy includes a revived and growing League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes, the largest management health care bargaining agent in the nation. We look forward to continued cooperation with that organization in the spirit of empathy for the needs of others that Ed Silver exemplified so magnificently. Our condolences to his loving family.
